<p>NIGHT</p>
<p>STREET BEFORE MARGARET'S DOOR</p>
<p>VALENTINE (<i>a soldier</i>, MARGARET'S <i>brother</i>)</p>
<p>When I have sat at some carouse.<br/>
Where each to each his brag allows,<br/>
And many a comrade praised to me<br/>
His pink of girls right lustily,<br/>
With brimming glass that spilled the toast,<br/>
And elbows planted as in boast:<br/>
I sat in unconcerned repose,<br/>
And heard the swagger as it rose.<br/>
And stroking then my beard, I'd say,<br/>
Smiling, the bumper in my hand:<br/>
"Each well enough in her own way.<br/>
But is there one in all the land<br/>
Like sister Margaret, good as gold,—<br/>
One that to her can a candle hold?"<br/>
Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went around<br/>
The board: "He speaks the truth!" cried some;<br/>
"In her the flower o' the sex is found!"<br/>
And all the swaggerers were dumb.<br/>
And now!—I could tear my hair with vexation.<br/>
And dash out my brains in desperation!<br/>
With turned-up nose each scamp may face me,<br/>
With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me,<br/>
And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting,<br/>
A chance-dropped word may set me sweating!<br/>
Yet, though I thresh them all together,<br/>
I cannot call them liars, either.</p>
<p>But what comes sneaking, there, to view?<br/>
If I mistake not, there are two.<br/>
If <i>he's</i> one, let me at him drive!<br/>
He shall not leave the spot alive.</p>
<p>FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>How from the window of the sacristy<br/>
Upward th'eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer,<br/>
That, lessening side-wards, fainter grows and dimmer,<br/>
Till darkness closes from the sky!<br/>
The shadows thus within my bosom gather.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I'm like a sentimental tom-cat, rather,<br/>
That round the tall fire-ladders sweeps,<br/>
And stealthy, then, along the coping creeps:<br/>
Quite virtuous, withal, I come,<br/>
A little thievish and a little frolicsome.<br/>
I feel in every limb the presage<br/>
Forerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night:<br/>
Day after to-morrow brings its message,<br/>
And one keeps watch then with delight.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Meanwhile, may not the treasure risen be,<br/>
Which there, behind, I glimmering see?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Shalt soon experience the pleasure,<br/>
To lift the kettle with its treasure.<br/>
I lately gave therein a squint—<br/>
Saw splendid lion-dollars in 't.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Not even a jewel, not a ring,<br/>
To deck therewith my darling girl?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I saw, among the rest, a thing<br/>
That seemed to be a chain of pearl.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>That's well, indeed! For painful is it<br/>
To bring no gift when her I visit.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Thou shouldst not find it so annoying,<br/>
Without return to be enjoying.<br/>
Now, while the sky leads forth its starry throng,<br/>
Thou'lt hear a masterpiece, no work completer:<br/>
I'll sing her, first, a moral song,<br/>
The surer, afterwards, to cheat her.</p>

<p>VALENTINE (<i>comes forward</i>)</p>
<p>Whom wilt thou lure? God's-element!<br/>
Rat-catching piper, thou!—perdition!<br/>
To the Devil, first, the instrument!<br/>
To the Devil, then, the curst musician!</p>

<p>There's yet a skull I must be splitting!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>to</i> FAUST)</p>
<p>Sir Doctor, don't retreat, I pray!<br/>
Stand by: I'll lead, if you'll but tarry:<br/>
Out with your spit, without delay!<br/>
You've but to lunge, and I will parry.</p>
<p>VALENTINE</p>
<p>Then parry that!</p>

Why howl, you women there? Instead,<br/>
Come here and listen, every one!</p>
<p>(<i>All gather around him</i>)</p>
<p>My Margaret, see! still young thou art,<br/>
But not the least bit shrewd or smart,<br/>
Thy business thus to slight:<br/>
So this advice I bid thee heed—<br/>
Now that thou art a whore indeed,<br/>
Why, be one then, outright!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>My brother! God! such words to me?</p>
<p>VALENTINE</p>
<p>In this game let our Lord God be!<br/>
What's done's already done, alas!<br/>
What follows it, must come to pass.<br/>
With one begin'st thou secretly,<br/>
Then soon will others come to thee,<br/>
And when a dozen thee have known,<br/>
Thou'rt also free to all the town.<br/>
When Shame is born and first appears,<br/>
She is in secret brought to light,<br/>
And then they draw the veil of night<br/>
Over her head and ears;<br/>
Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her.<br/>
But let her growth and strength display,<br/>
She walks abroad unveiled by day,<br/>
Yet is not grown a whit the fairer.<br/>
The uglier she is to sight,<br/>
The more she seeks the day's broad light.<br/>
The time I verily can discern<br/>
When all the honest folk will turn<br/>
From thee, thou jade! and seek protection<br/>
As from a corpse that breeds infection.<br/>
Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee.<br/>
When they but look thee in the face:—<br/>
Shalt not in a golden chain array thee,<br/>
Nor at the altar take thy place!<br/>
Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing,<br/>
Make merry when the dance is going!<br/>
But in some corner, woe betide thee!<br/>
Among the beggars and cripples hide thee;<br/>
And so, though even God forgive,<br/>
On earth a damned existence live!</p>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>Commend your soul to God for pardon,<br/>
That you your heart with slander harden!</p>
<p>VALENTINE</p>
<p>Thou pimp most infamous, be still!<br/>
Could I thy withered body kill,<br/>
'Twould bring, for all my sinful pleasure,<br/>
Forgiveness in the richest measure.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>My brother! This is Hell's own pain!</p>
<p>VALENTINE</p>
<p>I tell thee, from thy tears refrain!<br/>
When thou from honor didst depart<br/>
It stabbed me to the very heart.<br/>
Now through the slumber of the grave<br/>
I go to God as a soldier brave.</p>

<p>DOST thou not wish a broomstick-steed's assistance?<br/>
The sturdiest he-goat I would gladly see:<br/>
The way we take, our goal is yet some distance.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence.<br/>
This knotted staff suffices me.<br/>
What need to shorten so the way?<br/>
Along this labyrinth of vales to wander,<br/>
Then climb the rocky ramparts yonder,<br/>
Wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray,<br/>
Is such delight, my steps would fain delay.<br/>
The spring-time stirs within the fragrant birches,<br/>
And even the fir-tree feels it now:<br/>
Should then our limbs escape its gentle searches?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I notice no such thing, I vow!<br/>
'Tis winter still within my body:<br/>
Upon my path I wish for frost and snow.<br/>
How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy,<br/>
The moon's lone disk, with its belated glow,<br/>
And lights so dimly, that, as one advances,<br/>
At every step one strikes a rock or tree!<br/>
Let us, then, use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances:<br/>
I see one yonder, burning merrily.<br/>
Ho, there! my friend! I'll levy thine attendance:<br/>
Why waste so vainly thy resplendence?<br/>
Be kind enough to light us up the steep!</p>

Now, in the Devil's name, go straight,<br/>

<p>You are the master of the house, I mark,<br/>
And I shall try to serve you nicely.<br/>
But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day,<br/>

You mustn't take things too precisely.</p>

Here burns the glow through film and haze:<br/>
Now like a tender thread it creepeth,<br/>
Now like a fountain leaps and plays.<br/>
Here winds away, and in a hundred<br/>

Itself detaches, spreads and fades.<br/>
Here gush the sparkles incandescent<br/>
Like scattered showers of golden sand;—<br/>

<p><span class="c5">To cheer the witch will salve avail;</span><br/>
<span class="c5">A rag will answer for a sail;</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Each trough a goodly ship supplies;</span><br/>
<span class="c5">He ne'er will fly, who now not flies.</span><br/></p>
<p>BOTH CHORUSES</p>
<p><span class="c5">When round the summit whirls our flight,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Then lower, and on the ground alight;</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And far and wide the heather press</span><br/>
<span class="c5">With witchhood's swarms of wantonness!</span><br/></p>
<p>(<i>They settle down</i>.)</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>They crowd and push, they roar and clatter!<br/>
They whirl and whistle, pull and chatter!<br/>
They shine, and spirt, and stink, and burn!<br/>
The true witch-element we learn.<br/>
Keep close! or we are parted, in our turn,<br/>
Where art thou?</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>in the distance</i>)</p>
<p>Here!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>What! whirled so far astray?<br/></p>
</div>
<p>Then house-right I must use, and clear the way.<br/>
Make room! Squire Voland comes! Room, gentle rabble,<br/>
room!<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>Here, Doctor, hold to me: in one jump we'll resume<br/>
An easier space, and from the crowd be free:<br/>
It's too much, even for the like of me.<br/>
Yonder, with special light, there's something shining clearer<br/>
Within those bushes; I've a mind to see.<br/>
Come on! we'll slip a little nearer.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Spirit of Contradiction! On! I'll follow straight.<br/>
'Tis planned most wisely, if I judge aright:<br/>
We climb the Brocken's top in the Walpurgis-Night,<br/>
That arbitrarily, here, ourselves we isolate.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>But see, what motley flames among the heather!<br/>
There is a lively club together:<br/>
In smaller circles one is not alone.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Better the summit, I must own:<br/>
There fire and whirling smoke I see.<br/>
They seek the Evil One in wild confusion:<br/>
Many enigmas there might find solution.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>But there enigmas also knotted be.<br/>
Leave to the multitude their riot!<br/>
Here will we house ourselves in quiet.<br/>
It is an old, transmitted trade,<br/>
That in the greater world the little worlds are made.<br/>
I see stark-nude young witches congregate,<br/>
And old ones, veiled and hidden shrewdly:<br/>
On my account be kind, nor treat them rudely!<br/>
The trouble's small, the fun is great.<br/>
I hear the noise of instruments attuning,—<br/>
Vile din! yet one must learn to bear the crooning.<br/>
Come, come along! It <i>must</i> be, I declare!<br/>
I'll go ahead and introduce thee there,<br/>
Thine obligation newly earning.<br/>
That is no little space: what say'st thou, friend?<br/>
Look yonder! thou canst scarcely see the end:<br/>
A hundred fires along the ranks are burning.<br/>
They dance, they chat, they cook, they drink, they court:<br/>
Now where, just tell me, is there better sport?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Wilt thou, to introduce us to the revel,<br/>
Assume the part of wizard or of devil?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I'm mostly used, 'tis true, to go incognito,<br/>
But on a gala-day one may his orders show.<br/>
The Garter does not deck my suit,<br/>
But honored and at home is here the cloven foot.<br/>
Perceiv'st thou yonder snail? It cometh, slow and steady;<br/>
So delicately its feelers pry,<br/>
That it hath scented me already:<br/>
I cannot here disguise me, if I try.<br/>
But come! we'll go from this fire to a newer:<br/>
I am the go-between, and thou the wooer.</p>
<p>(<i>To some, who are sitting around dying embers</i>:)</p>
<p>Old gentlemen, why at the outskirts? Enter!<br/>
I'd praise you if I found you snugly in the centre,<br/>
With youth and revel round you like a zone:<br/>
You each, at home, are quite enough alone.</p>
<p>GENERAL</p>
<p>Say, who would put his trust in nations,<br/>
Howe'er for them one may have worked and planned?<br/>
For with the people, as with women,<br/>
Youth always has the upper hand.</p>
<p>MINISTER</p>
<p>They're now too far from what is just and sage.<br/>
I praise the old ones, not unduly:<br/>
When we were all-in-all, then, truly,<br/>
<i>Then</i> was the real golden age.</p>
<p>PARVENU</p>
<p>We also were not stupid, either,<br/>
And what we should not, often did;<br/>
But now all things have from their bases slid,<br/>
Just as we meant to hold them fast together.</p>
<p>AUTHOR</p>
<p>Who, now, a work of moderate sense will read?<br/>
Such works are held as antiquate and mossy;<br/>
And as regards the younger folk, indeed,<br/>
They never yet have been so pert and saucy.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>(<i>who all at once appears very old</i>)</p>
<p>I feel that men are ripe for Judgment-Day,<br/>
Now for the last time I've the witches'-hill ascended:<br/>
Since to the lees <i>my</i> cask is drained away,<br/>
The world's, as well, must soon be ended.</p>
<p>HUCKSTER-WITCH</p>
<p>Ye gentlemen, don't pass me thus!<br/>
Let not the chance neglected be!<br/>
Behold my wares attentively:<br/>
The stock is rare and various.<br/>
And yet, there's nothing I've collected—<br/>
No shop, on earth, like this you'll find!—<br/>
Which has not, once, sore hurt inflicted<br/>
Upon the world, and on mankind.<br/>
No dagger's here, that set not blood to flowing;<br/>
No cup, that hath not once, within a healthy frame<br/>
Poured speedy death, in poison glowing:<br/>
No gems, that have not brought a maid to shame;<br/>
No sword, but severed ties for the unwary,<br/>
Or from behind struck down the adversary.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Gossip! the times thou badly comprehendest:<br/>
What's done has happed—what haps, is done!<br/>
'Twere better if for novelties thou sendest:<br/>
By such alone can we be won.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Let me not lose myself in all this pother!<br/>
This is a fair, as never was another!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>The whirlpool swirls to get above:<br/>
Thou'rt shoved thyself, imagining to shove.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>But who is that?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Note her especially,<br/>
Tis Lilith.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<div class="indented">
<p>Who?</p>
</div>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<div class="indenteds">
<p>Adam's first wife is she.<br/></p>

<p>Beware the lure within her lovely tresses,<br/>
The splendid sole adornment of her hair!<br/>
When she succeeds therewith a youth to snare,<br/>
Not soon again she frees him from her jesses.<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Those two, the old one with the young one sitting,<br/>
They've danced already more than fitting.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>No rest to-night for young or old!<br/>
They start another dance: come now, let us take hold!</p>

<span class="c5">I then beheld an apple-tree,</span><br/>

THE FAIR ONE<br/>
<br/>
<span class="c5">Apples have been desired by you,</span><br/>

<p>PROKTOPHANTASMIST</p>
<p>Accurséd folk! How dare you venture thus?<br/>
Had you not, long since, demonstration<br/>
That ghosts can't stand on ordinary foundation?<br/>
And now you even dance, like one of us!</p>
<p>THE FAIR ONE (<i>dancing</i>)</p>
<p>Why does he come, then, to our ball?</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>dancing</i>)</p>
<p>O, everywhere on him you fall!<br/>
When others dance, he weighs the matter:<br/>
If he can't every step bechatter,<br/>
Then 'tis the same as were the step not made;<br/>
But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed.<br/>
If you would whirl in regular gyration<br/>
As he does in his dull old mill,<br/>
He'd show, at any rate, good-will,—<br/>
Especially if you heard and heeded his hortation.</p>
<p>PROKTOPHANTASMIST</p>
<p>You still are here? Nay, 'tis a thing unheard!<br/>
Vanish, at once! We've said the enlightening word.<br/>
The pack of devils by no rules is daunted:<br/>
We are so wise, and yet is Tegel haunted.<br/>
To clear the folly out, how have I swept and stirred!<br/>
Twill ne'er be clean: why, 'tis a thing unheard!</p>
<p>THE FAIR ONE</p>
<p>Then cease to bore us at our ball!</p>
<p>PROKTOPHANTASMIST</p>
<p>I tell you, spirits, to your face,<br/>
I give to spirit-despotism no place;<br/>
My spirit cannot practise it at all.</p>
<p>(<i>The dance continues</i>)</p>
<p>Naught will succeed, I see, amid such revels;<br/>
Yet something from a tour I always save,<br/>
And hope, before my last step to the grave,<br/>
To overcome the poets and the devils.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>He now will seat him in the nearest puddle;<br/>
The solace this, whereof he's most assured:<br/>
And when upon his rump the leeches hang and fuddle,<br/>
He'll be of spirits and of Spirit cured.</p>
<p>(<i>To</i> FAUST, <i>who has left the dance</i>:)</p>
<p>Wherefore forsakest thou the lovely maiden,<br/>
That in the dance so sweetly sang?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Ah! in the midst of it there sprang<br/>
A red mouse from her mouth—sufficient reason.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>That's nothing! One must not so squeamish be;<br/>
So the mouse was not gray, enough for thee.<br/>
Who'd think of that in love's selected season?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Then saw I—.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<div class="indented">
<p>What?</p>
</div>
<p>FAUST</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>Mephisto, seest thou there,<br/></p>
</div>
<p>Alone and far, a girl most pale and fair?<br/>
She falters on, her way scarce knowing,<br/>
As if with fettered feet that stay her going.<br/>
I must confess, it seems to me<br/>
As if my kindly Margaret were she.<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Let the thing be! All thence have evil drawn:<br/>
It is a magic shape, a lifeless eidolon.<br/>
Such to encounter is not good:<br/>
Their blank, set stare benumbs the human blood,<br/>
And one is almost turned to stone.<br/>
Medusa's tale to thee is known.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Forsooth, the eyes they are of one whom, dying,<br/>
No hand with loving pressure closed;<br/>
That is the breast whereon I once was lying,—<br/>
The body sweet, beside which I reposed!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Tis magic all, thou fool, seduced so easily!<br/>
Unto each man his love she seems to be.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>The woe, the rapture, so ensnare me,<br/>
That from her gaze I cannot tear me!<br/>
And, strange! around her fairest throat<br/>
A single scarlet band is gleaming,<br/>
No broader than a knife-blade seeming!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Quite right! The mark I also note.<br/>
Her head beneath her arm she'll sometimes carry;<br/>
Twas Perseus lopped it, her old adversary.<br/>
Thou crav'st the same illusion still!<br/>
Come, let us mount this little hill;<br/>
The Prater shows no livelier stir,<br/>
And, if they've not bewitched my sense,<br/>
I verily see a theatre.<br/>
What's going on?</p>
<p>SERVIBILIS</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>'Twill shortly recommence:<br/></p>

<p>A new performance—'tis the last of seven.<br/>

'Twas by a Dilettante written,<br/>
And Dilettanti in the parts appear.<br/>
That now I vanish, pardon, I entreat you!<br/>
As Dilettante I the curtain raise.<br/>

<p>OBERON AND TITANIA's GOLDEN WEDDING</p>
<p>INTERMEZZO</p>
<p>MANAGER</p>
<p>Sons of Mieding, rest to-day!<br/>
Needless your machinery:<br/>
Misty vale and mountain gray,<br/>
That is all the scenery.</p>
<p>HERALD</p>
<p>That the wedding golden be.<br/>
Must fifty years be rounded:<br/>
But <i>the Golden</i> give to me,<br/>
When the strife's compounded.</p>
<p>OBERON</p>
<p>Spirits, if you're here, be seen—<br/>
Show yourselves, delighted!<br/>
Fairy king and fairy queen,<br/>
They are newly plighted.</p>
<p>PUCK</p>
<p>Cometh Puck, and, light of limb,<br/>
Whisks and whirls in measure:<br/>
Come a hundred after him,<br/>
To share with him the pleasure.</p>
<p>ARIEL</p>
<p>Ariel's song is heavenly-pure,<br/>
His tones are sweet and rare ones:<br/>
Though ugly faces he allure,<br/>
Yet he allures the fair ones.</p>
<p>OBERON</p>
<p>Spouses, who would fain agree,<br/>
Learn how we were mated!<br/>
If your pairs would loving be,<br/>
First be separated!</p>
<p>TITANIA</p>
<p>If her whims the wife control,<br/>
And the man berate her,<br/>
Take him to the Northern Pole,<br/>
And her to the Equator!</p>

<p><i>Fortissimo</i>.</p>

And kin of all conditions,<br/>
Frog in grass, and cricket-trill,—<br/>
These are the musicians!</p>
<p>SOLO</p>
<p>See the bagpipe on our track!<br/>
'Tis the soap-blown bubble:<br/>
Hear the <i>schnecke-schnicke-schnack</i><br/>
Through his nostrils double!</p>
<p>SPIRIT, JUST GROWING INTO FORM</p>
<p>Spider's foot and paunch of toad,<br/>
And little wings—we know 'em!<br/>
A little creature 'twill not be,<br/>
But yet, a little poem.</p>
<p>A LITTLE COUPLE</p>
<p>Little step and lofty leap<br/>
Through honey-dew and fragrance:<br/>
You'll never mount the airy steep<br/>
With all your tripping vagrance.</p>
<p>INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER</p>
<p>Is't but masquerading play?<br/>
See I with precision?<br/>
Oberon, the beauteous fay,<br/>
Meets, to-night, my vision!</p>
<p>ORTHODOX</p>
<p>Not a claw, no tail I see!<br/>
And yet, beyond a cavil,<br/>
Like "the Gods of Greece," must he<br/>
Also be a devil.</p>
<p>NORTHERN ARTIST</p>
<p>I only seize, with sketchy air,<br/>
Some outlines of the tourney;<br/>
Yet I betimes myself prepare<br/>
For my Italian journey.</p>
<p>PURIST</p>
<p>My bad luck brings me here, alas!<br/>
How roars the orgy louder!<br/>
And of the witches in the mass,<br/>
But only two wear powder.</p>
<p>YOUNG WITCH</p>
<p>Powder becomes, like petticoat,<br/>
A gray and wrinkled noddy;<br/>
So I sit naked on my goat,<br/>
And show a strapping body.</p>
<p>MATRON</p>
<p>We've too much tact and policy<br/>
To rate with gibes a scolder;<br/>
Yet, young and tender though you be,<br/>
I hope to see you moulder.</p>
<p>LEADER OF THE BAND</p>
<p>Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,<br/>
Don't swarm so round the Naked!<br/>
Frog in grass and cricket-trill,<br/>
Observe the time, and make it!</p>
<p>WEATHERCOCK (<i>towards one side</i>)</p>
<p>Society to one's desire!<br/>
Brides only, and the sweetest!<br/>
And bachelors of youth and fire.<br/>
And prospects the completest!</p>
<p>WEATHERCOCK (<i>towards the other side</i>)</p>
<p>And if the Earth don't open now<br/>
To swallow up each ranter,<br/>
Why, then will I myself, I vow,<br/>
Jump into hell instanter!</p>
<p>XENIES</p>
<p>Us as little insects see!<br/>
With sharpest nippers flitting,<br/>
That our Papa Satan we<br/>
May honor as is fitting.</p>
<p>HENNINGS</p>
<p>How, in crowds together massed,<br/>
They are jesting, shameless!<br/>
They will even say, at last,<br/>
That their hearts are blameless.</p>
<p>MUSAGETES</p>
<p>Among this witches' revelry<br/>
His way one gladly loses;<br/>
And, truly, it would easier be<br/>
Than to command the Muses.</p>
<p>CI-DEVANT GENIUS OF THE AGE</p>
<p>The proper folks one's talents laud:<br/>
Come on, and none shall pass us!<br/>
The Blocksberg has a summit broad,<br/>
Like Germany's Parnassus.</p>
<p>INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER</p>
<p>Say, who's the stiff and pompous man?<br/>
He walks with haughty paces:<br/>
He snuffles all he snuffle can:<br/>
"He scents the Jesuits' traces."</p>
<p>CRANE</p>
<p>Both clear and muddy streams, for me<br/>
Are good to fish and sport in:<br/>
And thus the pious man you see<br/>
With even devils consorting.</p>
<p>WORLDLING</p>
<p>Yes, for the pious, I suspect,<br/>
All instruments are fitting;<br/>
And on the Blocksberg they erect<br/>
Full many a place of meeting.</p>

I hear the distant drumming.<br/>
"Don't be disturbed! 'tis, in the reeds,<br/>
The bittern's changeless booming."</p>
<p>DANCING-MASTER</p>
<p>How each his legs in nimble trip<br/>
Lifts up, and makes a clearance!<br/>
The crooked jump, the heavy skip,<br/>
Nor care for the appearance.</p>
<p>GOOD FELLOW</p>

To maim and slay delights them:<br/>
As Orpheus' lyre the brutes compelled,<br/>
The bagpipe here unites them.</p>
<p>DOGMATIST</p>
<p>I'll not be led by any lure<br/>
Of doubts or critic-cavils:<br/>
The Devil must be something, sure,—<br/>
Or how should there be devils?</p>
<p>IDEALIST</p>
<p>This once, the fancy wrought in me<br/>
Is really too despotic:<br/>
Forsooth, if I am all I see,<br/>
I must be idiotic!</p>
<p>REALIST</p>
<p>This racking fuss on every hand,<br/>
It gives me great vexation;<br/>
And, for the first time, here I stand<br/>
On insecure foundation.</p>
<p>SUPERNATURALIST</p>
<p>With much delight I see the play,<br/>
And grant to these their merits,<br/>
Since from the devils I also may<br/>
Infer the better spirits.</p>
<p>SCEPTIC</p>
<p>The flame they follow, on and on,<br/>
And think they're near the treasure:<br/>
But <i>Devil</i> rhymes with <i>Doubt</i> alone,<br/>
So I am here with pleasure.</p>

<p>Frog in green, and cricket-trill.<br/>
Such dilettants!—perdition!<br/>
Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,—<br/>
Each one's a fine musician!</p>
<p>THE ADROIT</p>
<p><i>Sans souci</i>, we call the clan<br/>
Of merry creatures so, then;<br/>
Go a-foot no more we can,<br/>
And on our heads we go, then.</p>
<p>THE AWKWARD</p>
<p>Once many a bit we sponged, but now,<br/>
God help us! that is done with:<br/>
Our shoes are all danced out, we trow,<br/>
We've but naked soles to run with.</p>
<p>WILL-O'-THE WISPS</p>
<p>From the marshes we appear,<br/>
Where we originated;<br/>
Yet in the ranks, at once, we're here<br/>
As glittering gallants rated.</p>
<p>SHOOTING-STAR</p>
<p>Darting hither from the sky,<br/>
In star and fire light shooting,<br/>
Cross-wise now in grass I lie:<br/>
Who'll help me to my footing?</p>
<p>THE HEAVY FELLOWS</p>
<p>Room! and round about us, room!<br/>
Trodden are the grasses:<br/>
Spirits also, spirits come,<br/>
And they are bulky masses.</p>
<p>PUCK</p>
<p>Enter not so stall-fed quite,<br/>
Like elephant-calves about one!<br/>
And the heaviest weight to-night<br/>
Be Puck, himself, the stout one!</p>
<p>ARIEL</p>
<p>If loving Nature at your back,<br/>
Or Mind, the wings uncloses,<br/>
Follow up my airy track<br/>
To the mount of roses!</p>
<p>ORCHESTRA</p>
<p><i>pianissimo</i><br/>
Cloud and trailing mist o'erhead<br/>
Are now illuminated:<br/>
Air in leaves, and wind in reed,<br/>
And all is dissipated.</p>
