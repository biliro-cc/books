<p>DREARY DAY</p>
<p>A FIELD</p>
<p>FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>In misery! In despair! Long wretchedly astray on the face<br/>
of the earth, and now imprisoned! That gracious, ill-starred<br/>
creature shut in a dungeon as a criminal, and given<br/>
up to fearful torments! To this has it come! to this!—Treacherous,<br/>
contemptible spirit, and thou hast concealed it from<br/>
me!—Stand, then,—stand! Roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in<br/>
thy head! Stand and defy me with thine intolerable presence!<br/>
Imprisoned! In irretrievable misery! Delivered up to evil<br/>
spirits, and to condemning, unfeeling Man! And thou hast<br/>
lulled me, meanwhile, with the most insipid dissipations, hast<br/>
concealed from me her increasing wretchedness, and suffered<br/>
her to go helplessly to ruin!</p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<div class="center"><a id="illus-231"/> &lt;i&gt;Roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in thy head&lt;/i&gt;</div>
<h4 id="pgepubid00034">Roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in thy head</h4>

<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>She is not the first.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Dog! Abominable monster! Transform him, thou Infinite<br/>
Spirit! transform the reptile again into his dog-shape? in which<br/>
it pleased him often at night to scamper on before me, to roll<br/>
himself at the feet of the unsuspecting wanderer, and hang<br/>
upon his shoulders when he fell! Transform him again into<br/>
his favorite likeness, that he may crawl upon his belly in the<br/>
dust before me,—that I may trample him, the outlawed, under<br/>
foot! Not the first! O woe! woe which no human soul can<br/>
grasp, that more than one being should sink into the depths<br/>
of this misery,—that the first, in its writhing death-agony<br/>
under the eyes of the Eternal Forgiver, did not expiate the<br/>
guilt of all others! The misery of this single one pierces to the<br/>
very marrow of my life; and thou art calmly grinning at the<br/>
fate of thousands!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Now we are already again at the end of our wits, where the<br/>
understanding of you men runs wild. Why didst thou enter<br/>
into fellowship with us, if thou canst not carry it out? Wilt fly,<br/>
and art not secure against dizziness? Did we thrust ourselves<br/>
upon thee, or thou thyself upon us?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Gnash not thus thy devouring teeth at me? It fills me with<br/>
horrible disgust. Mighty, glorious Spirit, who hast vouchsafed<br/>
to me Thine apparition, who knowest my heart and my soul,<br/>
why fetter me to the felon-comrade, who feeds on mischief and<br/>
gluts himself with ruin?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Hast thou done?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Rescue her, or woe to thee! The fearfullest curse be upon<br/>
thee for thousands of ages!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I cannot loosen the bonds of the Avenger, nor undo his bolts.<br/>
Rescue her? Who was it that plunged her into ruin? I, or thou?</p>
<p>(FAUST <i>looks around wildly</i>.)</p>
<p>Wilt thou grasp the thunder? Well that it has not been<br/>
given to you, miserable mortals! To crush to pieces the innocent<br/>
respondent—that is the tyrant-fashion of relieving one's<br/>
self in embarrassments.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Take me thither! She shall be free!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>And the danger to which thou wilt expose thyself? Know<br/>
that the guilt of blood, from thy hand, still lies upon the town!<br/>
Avenging spirits hover over the spot where the victim fell, and<br/>
lie in wait for the returning murderer.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>That, too, from thee? Murder and death of a world upon<br/>
thee, monster! Take me thither, I say, and liberate her!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I will convey thee there; and hear, what I can do! Have I<br/>
all the power in Heaven and on Earth? I will becloud the<br/>
jailer's senses: get possession of the key, and lead her forth with<br/>
human hand! I will keep watch: the magic steeds are ready,<br/>
I will carry you off. So much is in my power.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Up and away!</p>

<p>DUNGEON</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>(<i>with a bunch of keys and a lamp, before an iron door</i>)</p>
<p>A shudder, long unfelt, comes o'er me;<br/>
Mankind's collected woe o'erwhelms me, here.<br/>
She dwells within the dark, damp walls before me,<br/>
And all her crime was a delusion dear!<br/>
What! I delay to free her?<br/>
I dread, once again to see her?<br/>
On! my shrinking but lingers Death more near.</p>
<p>(<i>He grasps the lock: the sound of singing is heard inside</i>.)</p>
<div class="indented">
<p><i>My mother, the harlot,</i><br/>
Who put me to death;<br/>
My father, the varlet,<br/>
Who eaten me hath!<br/>
Little sister, so good,<br/>
Laid my bones in the wood,<br/>
In the damp moss and clay:<br/>
<i>Then was I a beautiful bird o' the wood;</i><br/>
Fly away! Fly away!<br/></p>
</div>
<p>FAUST <i>(unlocking)</i></p>
<p>She does not dream her lover listens near;<br/>
That he the rattling chain, the rustling straw, can hear.</p>
<p><i>(He enters</i>.)</p>
<p>MARGARET (<i>hiding herself on the pallet</i>)<br/>
Woe! woe! They come. O death of bitterness!</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>whispering</i>)<br/>
Hush! hush! The hour is come that frees thee.</p>
<p>MARGARET (<i>throwing herself before him</i>)<br/>
Art thou a man, then pity my distress!</p>
<p>FAUST<br/>
Thy cries will wake the guards, and they will seize thee!<br/>
(<i>He takes hold of the fetters to unlock them</i>.)</p>
<p>MARGARET (<i>on her knees</i>)</p>
<p>Who, headsman! unto thee such power<br/>
Over me could give?<br/>
Thou'rt come for me at midnight-hour:<br/>
Have mercy on me, let me live!<br/>
Is't not soon enough when morning chime has run?</p>
<p>(<i>She rises</i>.)</p>
<p>And I am yet so young, so young!<br/>
And now Death comes, and ruin!<br/>
I, too, was fair, and that was my undoing.<br/>
My love was near, but now he's far;<br/>
Torn lies the wreath, scattered the blossoms are.<br/>
Seize me not thus so violently!<br/>
Spare me! What have I done to thee?<br/>
Let me not vainly entreat thee!<br/>
I never chanced, in all my days, to meet thee!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Shall I outlive this misery?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Now am I wholly in thy might.<br/>
But let me suckle, first, my baby!<br/>
I blissed it all this livelong night;<br/>
They took 't away, to vex me, maybe,<br/>
And now they say I killed the child outright.<br/>
And never shall I be glad again.<br/>
They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it!<br/>
There's an old story has the same refrain;<br/>
Who bade them so construe it?</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>falling upon his knees</i>)</p>
<p>Here lieth one who loves thee ever,<br/>
The thraldom of thy woe to sever.</p>
<p>MARGARET (<i>flinging herself beside him</i>)</p>
<p>O let us kneel, and call the Saints to hide us!<br/>
Under the steps beside us,<br/>
The threshold under,<br/>
Hell heaves in thunder!<br/>
The Evil One<br/>
With terrible wrath<br/>
Seeketh a path<br/>
His prey to discover!</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>aloud</i>)</p>
<p>Margaret! Margaret!</p>
<p>MARGARET (<i>attentively listening</i>)</p>
<p>That was the voice of my lover!</p>
<p>(<i>She springs to her feet: the fetters fall off</i>.)</p>
<p>Where is he? I heard him call me.<br/>
I am free! No one shall enthrall me.<br/>
To his neck will I fly,<br/>
On his bosom lie!<br/>
On the threshold he stood, and <i>Margaret</i>! calling,<br/>
Midst of Hell's howling and noises appalling,<br/>
Midst of the wrathful, infernal derision,<br/>
I knew the sweet sound of the voice of the vision!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>'Tis I!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>'Tis thou! O, say it once again!</p>
<p>(<i>Clasping him</i>.)</p>
<p>'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain?<br/>
The anguish of the dungeon, and the chain?<br/>
'Tis thou! Thou comest to save me,<br/>
And I am saved!—<br/>
Again the street I see<br/>
Where first I looked on thee;<br/>
And the garden, brightly blooming,<br/>
Where I and Martha wait thy coming.</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>struggling to leave</i>)</p>
<p>Come! Come with me!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Delay, now!<br/>
So fain I stay, when thou delayest!</p>
<p>(<i>Caressing him</i>.)</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Away, now!<br/>
If longer here thou stayest,<br/>
We shall be made to dearly rue it.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Kiss me!—canst no longer do it?<br/>
My friend, so short a time thou'rt missing,<br/>
And hast unlearned thy kissing?<br/>
Why is my heart so anxious, on thy breast?<br/>
Where once a heaven thy glances did create me,<br/>
A heaven thy loving words expressed,<br/>
And thou didst kiss, as thou wouldst suffocate me—<br/>
Kiss me!<br/>
Or I'll kiss thee!</p>
<p>(<i>She embraces him</i>.)</p>
<p>Ah, woe! thy lips are chill,<br/>
And still.<br/>
How changed in fashion<br/>
Thy passion!<br/>
Who has done me this ill?</p>
<p>(<i>She turns away from him</i>.)</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Come, follow me! My darling, be more bold:<br/>
I'll clasp thee, soon, with warmth a thousand-fold;<br/>
But follow now! 'Tis all I beg of thee.</p>
<p>MARGARET (<i>turning to him</i>)</p>
<p>And is it thou? Thou, surely, certainly?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>'Tis I! Come on!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<div class="indenteds">
<p>Thou wilt unloose my chain,<br/></p>
</div>
<p>And in thy lap wilt take me once again.<br/>
How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?—<br/>
Say, dost thou know, my friend, whom thou mak'st free?<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Come! come! The night already vanisheth.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>My mother have I put to death;<br/>
I've drowned the baby born to thee.<br/>
Was it not given to thee and me?<br/>
Thee, too!—'Tis thou! It scarcely true doth seem—<br/>
Give me thy hand! 'Tis not a dream!<br/>
Thy dear, dear hand!—But, ah, 'tis wet!<br/>
Why, wipe it off! Methinks that yet<br/>
There's blood thereon.<br/>
Ah, God! what hast thou done?<br/>
Nay, sheathe thy sword at last!<br/>
Do not affray me!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>O, let the past be past!<br/>
Thy words will slay me!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>No, no! Thou must outlive us.<br/>
Now I'll tell thee the graves to give us:<br/>
Thou must begin to-morrow<br/>
The work of sorrow!<br/>
The best place give to my mother,<br/>
Then close at her side my brother,<br/>
And me a little away,<br/>
But not too very far, I pray!<br/>
And here, on my right breast, my baby lay!<br/>
Nobody else will lie beside me!—<br/>
Ah, within thine arms to hide me,<br/>
That was a sweet and a gracious bliss,<br/>
But no more, no more can I attain it!<br/>
I would force myself on thee and constrain it,<br/>
And it seems thou repellest my kiss:<br/>
And yet 'tis thou, so good, so kind to see!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>If thou feel'st it is I, then come with me!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Out yonder?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>To freedom.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>If the grave is there,<br/>
Death lying in wait, then come!<br/>
From here to eternal rest:<br/>
No further step—no, no!<br/>
Thou goest away! O Henry, if I could go!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Thou canst! Just will it! Open stands the door.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>I dare not go: there's no hope any more.<br/>
Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay!<br/>
It is so wretched, forced to beg my living,<br/>
And a bad conscience sharper misery giving!<br/>
It is so wretched, to be strange, forsaken,<br/>
And I'd still be followed and taken!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>I'll stay with thee.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Be quick! Be quick!<br/>
Save thy perishing child!<br/>
Away! Follow the ridge<br/>
Up by the brook,</p>

<hr class="c1"/>
<p>Over the bridge,<br/>
Into the wood,<br/>
To the left, where the plank is placed<br/>
In the pool!<br/>
Seize it in haste!<br/>
'Tis trying to rise,<br/>
'Tis struggling still!<br/>
Save it! Save it!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Recall thy wandering will!<br/>
One step, and thou art free at last!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>If the mountain we had only passed!<br/>
There sits my mother upon a stone,—<br/>
I feel an icy shiver!<br/>
There sits my mother upon a stone,<br/>
And her head is wagging ever.<br/>
She beckons, she nods not, her heavy head falls o'er;<br/>
She slept so long that she wakes no more.<br/>
She slept, while we were caressing:<br/>
Ah, those were the days of blessing!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Here words and prayers are nothing worth;<br/>
I'll venture, then, to bear thee forth.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>No—let me go! I'll suffer no force!<br/>
Grasp me not so murderously!<br/>
I've done, else, all things for the love of thee.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>The day dawns: Dearest! Dearest!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Day? Yes, the day comes,—the last day breaks for me!<br/>
My wedding-day it was to be!<br/>
Tell no one thou has been with Margaret!<br/>
Woe for my garland! The chances<br/>
Are over—'tis all in vain!<br/>
We shall meet once again,<br/>
But not at the dances!<br/>
The crowd is thronging, no word is spoken:<br/>
The square below<br/>
And the streets overflow:<br/>
The death-bell tolls, the wand is broken.<br/>
I am seized, and bound, and delivered—<br/>
Shoved to the block—they give the sign!<br/>
Now over each neck has quivered<br/>
The blade that is quivering over mine.<br/>
Dumb lies the world like the grave!</p>

<p>O had I ne'er been born!</p>

Useless talking, delaying and praying!<br/>
My horses are neighing:<br/>
The morning twilight is near.</p>

He! he! suffer him not!<br/>
What does he want in this holy spot?<br/>
He seeks me!</p>

<br/>1.F.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<br/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
<br/>your equipment.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
<br/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

<br/>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
<br/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
<br/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
<br/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
<br/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
<br/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
<br/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
<br/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
<br/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
<br/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
<br/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
<br/>opportunities to fix the problem.

<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
<br/>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

<br/>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
<br/>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
<br/>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<br/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<br/>people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<br/>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
<br/>and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

<br/>
<br/>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<br/>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<br/>particular state visit https://pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
<br/>donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate

<br/>
<br/>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<br/>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<br/>
<br/>     https://www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
