<p>WITCHES' KITCHEN</p>
<p>(<i>Upon a low hearth stands a great caldron, under which a fire<br/>
is burning. Various figures appear in the vapors which<br/>
rise from the caldron. An ape sits beside it, skims it, and<br/>
watches lest it boil over. The he-ape, with the young<br/>
ones, sits near and warms himself. Ceiling and walls are<br/>
covered with the most fantastic witch-implements</i>.)</p>
<p>FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>These crazy signs of witches' craft repel me!<br/>
I shall recover, dost thou tell me,<br/>
Through this insane, chaotic play?<br/>
From an old hag shall I demand assistance?<br/>
And will her foul mess take away<br/>
Full thirty years from my existence?<br/>
Woe's me, canst thou naught better find!<br/>
Another baffled hope must be lamented:<br/>
Has Nature, then, and has a noble mind<br/>
Not any potent balsam yet invented?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Once more, my friend, thou talkest sensibly.<br/>
There is, to make thee young, a simpler mode and apter;<br/>
But in another book 'tis writ for thee,<br/>
And is a most eccentric chapter.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Yet will I know it.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Good! the method is revealed<br/>
Without or gold or magic or physician.<br/>
Betake thyself to yonder field,<br/>
There hoe and dig, as thy condition;<br/>
Restrain thyself, thy sense and will<br/>
Within a narrow sphere to flourish;<br/>
With unmixed food thy body nourish;<br/>
Live with the ox as ox, and think it not a theft<br/>
That thou manur'st the acre which thou reapest;—<br/>
That, trust me, is the best mode left,<br/>
Whereby for eighty years thy youth thou keepest!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>I am not used to that; I cannot stoop to try it—<br/>
To take the spade in hand, and ply it.<br/>
The narrow being suits me not at all.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Then to thine aid the witch must call.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Wherefore the hag, and her alone?<br/>
Canst thou thyself not brew the potion?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>That were a charming sport, I own:<br/>
I'd build a thousand bridges meanwhile, I've a notion.<br/>
Not Art and Science serve, alone;<br/>
Patience must in the work be shown.<br/>
Long is the calm brain active in creation;<br/>
Time, only, strengthens the fine fermentation.<br/>
And all, belonging thereunto,<br/>
Is rare and strange, howe'er you take it:<br/>
The Devil taught the thing, 'tis true,<br/>
And yet the Devil cannot make it.<br/>
(<i>Perceiving the Animals</i>)<br/>
See, what a delicate race they be!<br/>
That is the maid! the man is he!<br/>
(<i>To the Animals</i>)<br/>
It seems the mistress has gone away?</p>
<p>THE ANIMALS</p>
<div class="indenteds">
<p>Carousing, to-day!<br/>
Off and about,<br/>
By the chimney out!</p>
</div>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>What time takes she for dissipating?</p>
<p>THE ANIMALS</p>
<p>While we to warm our paws are waiting.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>to</i> FAUST)</p>
<p>How findest thou the tender creatures?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Absurder than I ever yet did see.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Why, just such talk as this, for me,<br/>
Is that which has the most attractive features!</p>
<p>(<i>To the Animals</i>)</p>
<p>But tell me now, ye cursed puppets,<br/>
Why do ye stir the porridge so?</p>
<p>THE ANIMALS</p>
<p>We're cooking watery soup for beggars.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Then a great public you can show.</p>
<p>THE HE-APE</p>
<p>(<i>comes up and fawns on</i> MEPHISTOPHELES)</p>
<p><span class="c5">O cast thou the dice!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Make me rich in a trice,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Let me win in good season!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Things are badly controlled,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And had I but gold,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">So had I my reason.</span><br/></p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>How would the ape be sure his luck enhances.<br/>
Could he but try the lottery's chances!</p>
<p>(<i>In the meantime the young apes have been playing with a<br/>
large ball, which they now roll forward</i>.)</p>
<p>THE HE-APE</p>
<p><span class="c5">The world's the ball:</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Doth rise and fall,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And roll incessant:</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Like glass doth ring,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">A hollow thing,—</span><br/>
<span class="c5">How soon will't spring,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And drop, quiescent?</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Here bright it gleams,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Here brighter seems:</span><br/>
<span class="c5">I live at present!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Dear son, I say,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Keep thou away!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Thy doom is spoken!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">'Tis made of clay,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And will be broken.</span><br/></p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>What means the sieve?</p>
<p>THE HE-APE (<i>taking it down</i>)</p>
<p><span class="c5">Wert thou the thief,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">I'd know him and shame him.</span><br/>
<br/>
(<i>He runs to the</i> SHE-APE, <i>and lets her look through it</i>.)<br/>
<br/>
<span class="c5">Look through the sieve!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Know'st thou the thief,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And darest not name him?</span><br/></p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>approaching the fire)</i></p>
<p>And what's this pot?</p>
<p>HE-APE AND SHE-APE</p>
<p><span class="c5">The fool knows it not!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">He knows not the pot,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">He knows not the kettle!</span><br/></p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Impertinent beast!</p>
<p>THE HE-APE</p>
<p>Take the brush here, at least,<br/>
And sit down on the settle!</p>
<p>(<i>He invites</i> MEPHISTOPHELES <i>to sit down</i>.)</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>(<i>who during all this time has been standing before a mirror,<br/>
now approaching and now retreating from it</i>)</p>
<p>What do I see? What heavenly form revealed<br/>
Shows through the glass from Magic's fair dominions!<br/>
O lend me, Love, the swiftest of thy pinions,<br/>
And bear me to her beauteous field!<br/>
Ah, if I leave this spot with fond designing,<br/>
If I attempt to venture near,<br/>
Dim, as through gathering mist, her charms appear!—<br/>
A woman's form, in beauty shining!<br/>
Can woman, then, so lovely be?<br/>
And must I find her body, there reclining,<br/>
Of all the heavens the bright epitome?<br/>
Can Earth with such a thing be mated?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Why, surely, if a God first plagues Himself six days,<br/>
Then, self-contented, <i>Bravo</i>! says,<br/>
Must something clever be created.<br/>
This time, thine eyes be satiate!<br/>
I'll yet detect thy sweetheart and ensnare her,<br/>
And blest is he, who has the lucky fate,<br/>
Some day, as bridegroom, home to bear her.</p>
<p>(FAUST <i>gazes continually in the mirror</i>. MEPHISTOPHELES,<br/>
<i>stretching himself out on the settle, and playing with the<br/>
brush, continues to speak</i>.)</p>
<p>So sit I, like the King upon his throne:<br/>
I hold the sceptre, here,—and lack the crown alone.</p>
<p>THE ANIMALS</p>
<p>(<i>who up to this time have been making all kinds of fantastic<br/>
movements together bring a crown to</i> MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<i>with great noise</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="c5">O be thou so good</span><br/>
<span class="c5">With sweat and with blood</span><br/>
<span class="c5">The crown to belime!</span><br/></p>
<p>(<i>They handle the crown awkwardly and break it into two<br/>
pieces, with which they spring around</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="c5">'Tis done, let it be!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">We speak and we see,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">We hear and we rhyme!</span><br/></p>
<p>FAUST (<i>before the mirror</i>)</p>
<p>Woe's me! I fear to lose my wits.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>pointing to the Animals</i>)</p>
<p>My own head, now, is really nigh to sinking.</p>
<p>THE ANIMALS</p>
<p><span class="c5">If lucky our hits,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And everything fits,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">'Tis thoughts, and we're thinking!</span><br/></p>
<p>FAUST (<i>as above</i>)</p>
<p>My bosom burns with that sweet vision;<br/>
Let us, with speed, away from here!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>in the same attitude</i>)</p>
<p>One must, at least, make this admission—<br/>
They're poets, genuine and sincere.</p>
<p>(<i>The caldron, which the</i> SHE-APE <i>has up to this time neglected<br/>
to watch, begins to boil over: there ensues a great flame</i>,<br/>
<i>which blazes out the chimney. The</i> WITCH <i>comes careering<br/>
down through the flame, with terrible cries</i>.)</p>
<p>THE WITCH</p>
<p><span class="c5">Ow! ow! ow! ow!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">The damnéd beast—the curséd sow!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">To leave the kettle, and singe the Frau!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Accurséd fere!</span><br/></p>
<p>(<i>Perceiving</i> FAUST <i>and</i> MEPHISTOPHELES.)</p>
<p><span class="c5">What is that here?</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Who are you here?</span><br/>
<span class="c5">What want you thus?</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Who sneaks to us?</span><br/>
<span class="c5">The fire-pain</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Burn bone and brain!</span><br/></p>
<p>(<i>She plunges the skimming-ladle into the caldron, and scatters<br/>
flames towards</i> FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, <i>and the Animals.<br/>
The Animals whimper</i>.)</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>(<i>reversing the brush, which he has been holding in his hand,<br/>
and striding among the jars and glasses</i>)</p>
<p><span class="c4">In two! in two!</span><br/>
<span class="c4">There lies the brew!</span><br/>
<span class="c4">There lies the glass!</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The joke will pass,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">As time, foul ass!</span><br/>
<span class="c4">To the singing of thy crew.</span><br/></p>
<p>(<i>As the</i> WITCH <i>starts back, full of wrath and horror</i>)</p>
<p>Ha! know'st thou me? Abomination, thou!<br/>
Know'st thou, at last, thy Lord and Master?<br/>
What hinders me from smiting now<br/>
Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster?<br/>
Hast for the scarlet coat no reverence?<br/>
Dost recognize no more the tall cock's-feather?<br/>
Have I concealed this countenance?—<br/>
Must tell my name, old face of leather?</p>
<p>THE WITCH</p>
<p>O pardon, Sir, the rough salute!<br/>
Yet I perceive no cloven foot;<br/>
And both your ravens, where are <i>they</i> now?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>This time, I'll let thee 'scape the debt;<br/>
For since we two together met,<br/>
'Tis verily full many a day now.<br/>
Culture, which smooth the whole world licks,<br/>
Also unto the Devil sticks.<br/>
The days of that old Northern phantom now are over:<br/>
Where canst thou horns and tail and claws discover?<br/>
And, as regards the foot, which I can't spare, in truth,<br/>
'Twould only make the people shun me;<br/>
Therefore I've worn, like many a spindly youth,<br/>
False calves these many years upon me.</p>
<p>THE WITCH (<i>dancing</i>)</p>
<p>Reason and sense forsake my brain,<br/>
Since I behold Squire Satan here again!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Woman, from such a name refrain!</p>
<p>THE WITCH</p>
<p>Why so? What has it done to thee?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>It's long been written in the Book of Fable;<br/>
Yet, therefore, no whit better men we see:<br/>
The Evil One has left, the evil ones are stable.<br/>
Sir Baron call me thou, then is the matter good;<br/>
A cavalier am I, like others in my bearing.<br/>
Thou hast no doubt about my noble blood:<br/>
See, here's the coat-of-arms that I am wearing!</p>
<div class="indented">
<p>(<i>He makes an indecent gesture</i>.)</p>
</div>
<p>THE WITCH (<i>laughs immoderately</i>)</p>
<p>Ha! ha! That's just your way, I know:<br/>
A rogue you are, and you were always so.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>to</i> FAUST)</p>
<p>My friend, take proper heed, I pray!<br/>
To manage witches, this is just the way.</p>
<p>THE WITCH</p>
<p>Wherein, Sirs, can I be of use?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Give us a goblet of the well-known juice!<br/>
But, I must beg you, of the oldest brewage;<br/>
The years a double strength produce.</p>
<p>THE WITCH</p>
<p>With all my heart! Now, here's a bottle,<br/>
Wherefrom, sometimes, I wet my throttle,<br/>
Which, also, not the slightest, stinks;<br/>
And willingly a glass I'll fill him.</p>
<p>(<i>Whispering</i>)</p>
<p>Yet, if this man without due preparation drinks,<br/>
As well thou know'st, within an hour 'twill kill him.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>He is a friend of mine, with whom it will agree,<br/>
And he deserves thy kitchen's best potation:<br/>
Come, draw thy circle, speak thine adjuration,<br/>
And fill thy goblet full and free!</p>
<p>THE WITCH</p>
<p>(<i>with fantastic gestures draws a circle and places mysterious<br/>
articles therein; meanwhile the glasses begin to ring, the<br/>
caldron to sound, and make a musical accompaniment.<br/>
Finally she brings a great book, and stations in the circle<br/>

hold the torches. She then beckons</i> FAUST <i>to approach</i>.)</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>to</i> MEPHISTOPHELES)</p>
<p>Now, what shall come of this? the creatures antic,<br/>
The crazy stuff, the gestures frantic,—<br/>
All the repulsive cheats I view,—<br/>

<p>O, nonsense! That's a thing for laughter;<br/>
Don't be so terribly severe!<br/>
She juggles you as doctor now, that, after,<br/>
The beverage may work the proper cheer.</p>
<p>(<i>He persuades</i> FAUST <i>to step into the circle</i>.)</p>

<p>FAUST</p>
<p>She talks like one who raves in fever.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Thou'lt hear much more before we leave her.<br/>
'Tis all the same: the book I can repeat,<br/>
Such time I've squandered o'er the history:<br/>
A contradiction thus complete<br/>
Is always for the wise, no less than fools, a mystery.<br/>
The art is old and new, for verily<br/>
All ages have been taught the matter,—<br/>
By Three and One, and One and Three,<br/>
Error instead of Truth to scatter.<br/>
They prate and teach, and no one interferes;<br/>
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking.<br/>
Man usually believes, if only words he hears,<br/>
That also with them goes material for thinking!</p>
<p>THE WITCH (<i>continues</i>)</p>
<p><span class="c5">The lofty skill</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Of Science, still</span><br/>
<span class="c5">From all men deeply hidden!</span><br/>

<p>FAUST</p>
<p>What nonsense she declaims before us!<br/>
My head is nigh to split, I fear:<br/>
It seems to me as if I hear<br/>
A hundred thousand fools in chorus.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>O Sibyl excellent, enough of adjuration!<br/>
But hither bring us thy potation,<br/>
And quickly fill the beaker to the brim!<br/>
This drink will bring my friend no injuries:<br/>
He is a man of manifold degrees,<br/>
And many draughts are known to him.</p>
<p>(<i>The</i> WITCH, <i>with many ceremonies, pours the drink into a<br/>
cup; as</i> FAUST <i>sets it to his lips, a light flame arises</i>.)</p>
<p>Down with it quickly! Drain it off!<br/>
'Twill warm thy heart with new desire:<br/>
Art with the Devil hand and glove,<br/>
And wilt thou be afraid of fire?</p>
<p>(<i>The</i> WITCH <i>breaks the circle</i>: FAUST <i>steps forth</i>.)</p>

<p>Thy wish be on Walpurgis Night expressed;<br/>
What boon I have, shall then be given unto thee.</p>
<p>THE WITCH</p>
<p>Here is a song, which, if you sometimes sing,<br/>
You'll find it of peculiar operation.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES (<i>to</i> FAUST)</p>
<p>Come, walk at once! A rapid occupation<br/>
Must start the needful perspiration,<br/>
And through thy frame the liquor's potence fling.<br/>
The noble indolence I'll teach thee then to treasure,<br/>
And soon thou'lt be aware, with keenest thrills of pleasure,<br/>
How Cupid stirs and leaps, on light and restless wing.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>One rapid glance within the mirror give me,<br/>
How beautiful that woman-form!</p>

<p>No, no! The paragon of all, believe me,<br/>

Each woman beautiful as Helen!</p>

<p>Just think, the pocket of a priest should get<br/>
The trinkets left for Margaret!<br/>
The mother saw them, and, instanter,<br/>
A secret dread began to haunt her.<br/>
Keen scent has she for tainted air;<br/>
She snuffs within her book of prayer,<br/>
And smells each article, to see<br/>
If sacred or profane it be;<br/>
So here she guessed, from every gem,<br/>
That not much blessing came with them.<br/>
"My child," she said, "ill-gotten good<br/>
Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood.<br/>
Before the Mother of God we'll lay it;<br/>
With heavenly manna she'll repay it!"<br/>
But Margaret thought, with sour grimace,<br/>
"A gift-horse is not out of place,<br/>
And, truly! godless cannot be<br/>
The one who brought such things to me."<br/>
A parson came, by the mother bidden:<br/>
He saw, at once, where the game was hidden,<br/>
And viewed it with a favor stealthy.<br/>
He spake: "That is the proper view,—<br/>
Who overcometh, winneth too.<br/>
The Holy Church has a stomach healthy:<br/>
Hath eaten many a land as forfeit,<br/>
And never yet complained of surfeit:<br/>
The Church alone, beyond all question,<br/>
Has for ill-gotten goods the right digestion."</p>

He said: "I had no time for play, for gaping freedom:<br/>
First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,—<br/>
For bread, in the widest sense, to drudge,<br/>
And could not even eat my share in peace and quiet!"</p>

<p>Had he all love, all faith forgotten in his riot?<br/>

Said he: "When I from Malta went away<br/>
My prayers for wife and little ones were zealous,<br/>
And such a luck from Heaven befell us,<br/>
We made a Turkish merchantman our prey,<br/>
That to the Soldan bore a mighty treasure.<br/>
Then I received, as was most fit,<br/>
Since bravery was paid in fullest measure,<br/>

<p>Ah, God! another one so dear<br/>
As was my first, this world will hardly give me.<br/>
There never was a sweeter fool than mine,<br/>
Only he loved to roam and leave me,<br/>
And foreign wenches and foreign wine,<br/>
And the damned throw of dice, indeed.</p>
