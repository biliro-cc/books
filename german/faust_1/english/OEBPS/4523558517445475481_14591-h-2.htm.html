<p>THE STUDY</p>
<p>FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>A knock? Come in! Again my quiet broken?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>'Tis I!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p><span class="c13">Come in!</span><br/></p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p><span class="c14">Thrice must the words be spoken.</span><br/></p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Come in, then!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p><span class="c15">Thus thou pleasest me.</span><br/>
I hope we'll suit each other well;<br/>
For now, thy vapors to dispel,<br/>
I come, a squire of high degree,<br/>
In scarlet coat, with golden trimming,<br/>
A cloak in silken lustre swimming,<br/>
A tall cock's-feather in my hat,<br/>
A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,—<br/>
And I advise thee, brief and flat,<br/>
To don the self-same gay apparel,<br/>
That, from this den released, and free,<br/>
Life be at last revealed to thee!<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>This life of earth, whatever my attire,<br/>
Would pain me in its wonted fashion.<br/>
Too old am I to play with passion;<br/>
Too young, to be without desire.<br/>
What from the world have I to gain?<br/>
Thou shalt abstain—renounce—refrain!<br/>
Such is the everlasting song<br/>
That in the ears of all men rings,—<br/>
That unrelieved, our whole life long,<br/>
Each hour, in passing, hoarsely sings.<br/>
In very terror I at morn awake,<br/>
Upon the verge of bitter weeping,<br/>
To see the day of disappointment break,<br/>
To no one hope of mine—not one—its promise keeping:—<br/>
That even each joy's presentiment<br/>
With wilful cavil would diminish,<br/>
With grinning masks of life prevent<br/>
My mind its fairest work to finish!<br/>
Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously<br/>
Upon my couch of sleep I lay me:<br/>
There, also, comes no rest to me,<br/>
But some wild dream is sent to fray me.<br/>
The God that in my breast is owned<br/>
Can deeply stir the inner sources;<br/>
The God, above my powers enthroned,<br/>
He cannot change external forces.<br/>
So, by the burden of my days oppressed,<br/>
Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>And yet is never Death a wholly welcome guest.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>O fortunate, for whom, when victory glances,<br/>
The bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth!<br/>
Whom, after rapid, maddening dances,<br/>
In clasping maiden-arms he findeth!<br/>
O would that I, before that spirit-power,<br/>
Ravished and rapt from life, had sunken!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>And yet, by some one, in that nightly hour,<br/>
A certain liquid was not drunken.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Eavesdropping, ha! thy pleasure seems to be.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Though some familiar tone, retrieving<br/>
My thoughts from torment, led me on,<br/>
And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving<br/>
A faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawn,<br/>
Yet now I curse whate'er entices<br/>
And snares the soul with visions vain;<br/>
With dazzling cheats and dear devices<br/>
Confines it in this cave of pain!<br/>
Cursed be, at once, the high ambition<br/>
Wherewith the mind itself deludes!<br/>
Cursed be the glare of apparition<br/>
That on the finer sense intrudes!<br/>
Cursed be the lying dream's impression<br/>
Of name, and fame, and laurelled brow!<br/>
Cursed, all that flatters as possession,<br/>
As wife and child, as knave and plow!<br/>
Cursed Mammon be, when he with treasures<br/>
To restless action spurs our fate!<br/>
Cursed when, for soft, indulgent leisures,<br/>
He lays for us the pillows straight!<br/>
Cursed be the vine's transcendent nectar,—<br/>
The highest favor Love lets fall!<br/>
Cursed, also, Hope!—cursed Faith, the spectre!<br/>
And cursed be Patience most of all!</p>
<p>CHORUS OF SPIRITS (<i>invisible</i>)</p>
<p><span class="c5">Woe! woe!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Thou hast it destroyed,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">The beautiful world,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">With powerful fist:</span><br/>
<span class="c5">In ruin 'tis hurled,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">By the blow of a demigod shattered!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">The scattered</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Fragments into the Void we carry,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Deploring</span><br/>
<span class="c5">The beauty perished beyond restoring.</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Mightier</span><br/>
<span class="c5">For the children of men,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Brightlier</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Build it again,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">In thine own bosom build it anew!</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Bid the new career</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Commence,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">With clearer sense,</span><br/>
<span class="c5">And the new songs of cheer</span><br/>
<span class="c5">Be sung thereto!</span><br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
These are the small dependants<br/>
Who give me attendance.<br/>
Hear them, to deeds and passion<br/>
Counsel in shrewd old-fashion!<br/>
Into the world of strife,<br/>
Out of this lonely life<br/>
That of senses and sap has betrayed thee,<br/>
They would persuade thee.<br/>
This nursing of the pain forego thee,<br/>
That, like a vulture, feeds upon thy breast!<br/>
The worst society thou find'st will show thee<br/>
Thou art a man among the rest.<br/>
But 'tis not meant to thrust<br/>
Thee into the mob thou hatest!<br/>
I am not one of the greatest,<br/>
Yet, wilt thou to me entrust<br/>
Thy steps through life, I'll guide thee,—<br/>
Will willingly walk beside thee,—<br/>
Will serve thee at once and forever<br/>
With best endeavor,<br/>
And, if thou art satisfied,<br/>
Will as servant, slave, with thee abide.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
And what shall be my counter-service therefor?<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
The time is long: thou need'st not now insist.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
No—no! The Devil is an egotist,<br/>
And is not apt, without a why or wherefore,<br/>
"For God's sake," others to assist.<br/>
Speak thy conditions plain and clear!<br/>
With such a servant danger comes, I fear.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
<i>Here</i>, an unwearied slave, I'll wear thy tether,<br/>
And to thine every nod obedient be:<br/>
When <i>There</i> again we come together,<br/>
Then shalt thou do the same for me.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
The <i>There</i> my scruples naught increases.<br/>
When thou hast dashed this world to pieces,<br/>
The other, then, its place may fill.<br/>
Here, on this earth, my pleasures have their sources;<br/>
Yon sun beholds my sorrows in his courses;<br/>
And when from these my life itself divorces,<br/>
Let happen all that can or will!<br/>
I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponder<br/>
If there we cherish love or hate,<br/>
Or, in the spheres we dream of yonder,<br/>
A High and Low our souls await.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
In this sense, even, canst thou venture.<br/>
Come, bind thyself by prompt indenture,<br/>
And thou mine arts with joy shalt see:<br/>
What no man ever saw, I'll give to thee.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
Canst thou, poor Devil, give me whatsoever?<br/>
When was a human soul, in its supreme endeavor,<br/>
E'er understood by such as thou?<br/>
Yet, hast thou food which never satiates, now,—<br/>
The restless, ruddy gold hast thou,<br/>
That runs, quicksilver-like, one's fingers through,—<br/>
A game whose winnings no man ever knew,—<br/>
A maid that, even from my breast,<br/>
Beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances,<br/>
And Honor's godlike zest,<br/>
The meteor that a moment dances,—<br/>
Show me the fruits that, ere they're gathered, rot,<br/>
And trees that daily with new leafage clothe them!<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Such a demand alarms me not:<br/>
Such treasures have I, and can show them.<br/>
But still the time may reach us, good my friend.<br/>
When peace we crave and more luxurious diet.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet.<br/>
There let, at once, my record end!<br/>
Canst thou with lying flattery rule me,<br/>
Until, self-pleased, myself I see,—<br/>
Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool me,<br/>
Let that day be the last for me!<br/>
The bet I offer.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<span class="c15">Done!</span><br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<span class="c16">And heartily!</span><br/>
When thus I hail the Moment flying:<br/>
"Ah, still delay—thou art so fair!"<br/>
Then bind me in thy bonds undying,<br/>
My final ruin then declare!<br/>
Then let the death-bell chime the token.<br/>
Then art thou from thy service free!<br/>
The clock may stop, the hand be broken,<br/>
Then Time be finished unto me!<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Consider well: my memory good is rated.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
Thou hast a perfect right thereto.<br/>
My powers I have not rashly estimated:<br/>
A slave am I, whate'er I do—<br/>
If thine, or whose? 'tis needless to debate it.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Then at the Doctors'-banquet I, to-day,<br/>
Will as a servant wait behind thee.<br/>
But one thing more! Beyond all risk to bind thee,<br/>
Give me a line or two, I pray.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
Demand'st thou, Pedant, too, a document?<br/>
Hast never known a man, nor proved his word's intent?<br/>
Is't not enough, that what I speak to-day<br/>
Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing?<br/>
In all its tides sweeps not the world away,<br/>
And shall a promise bind my being?<br/>
Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear:<br/>
Who would himself therefrom deliver?<br/>
Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair!<br/>
No sacrifice shall he repent of ever.<br/>
Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care,<br/>
A spectre is, which all to shun endeavor.<br/>
The word, alas! dies even in the pen,<br/>
And wax and leather keep the lordship then.<br/>
What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?—<br/>
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay?<br/>
The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated?<br/>
I freely leave the choice to thee.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Why heat thyself, thus instantly,<br/>
With eloquence exaggerated?<br/>
Each leaf for such a pact is good;<br/>
And to subscribe thy name thou'lt take a drop of blood.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
If thou therewith art fully satisfied,<br/>
So let us by the farce abide.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Blood is a juice of rarest quality.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever?<br/>
The promise that I make to thee<br/>
Is just the sum of my endeavor.<br/>
I have myself inflated all too high;<br/>
My proper place is thy estate:<br/>
The Mighty Spirit deigns me no reply,<br/>
And Nature shuts on me her gate.<br/>
The thread of Thought at last is broken,<br/>
And knowledge brings disgust unspoken.<br/>
Let us the sensual deeps explore,<br/>
To quench the fervors of glowing passion!<br/>
Let every marvel take form and fashion<br/>
Through the impervious veil it wore!<br/>
Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance,<br/>
In the rush and roll of Circumstance!<br/>
Then may delight and distress,<br/>
And worry and success,<br/>
Alternately follow, as best they can:<br/>
Restless activity proves the man!<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
For you no bound, no term is set.<br/>
Whether you everywhere be trying,<br/>
Or snatch a rapid bliss in flying,<br/>
May it agree with you, what you get!<br/>
Only fall to, and show no timid balking.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
But thou hast heard, 'tis not of joy we're talking.<br/>
I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain,<br/>
Enamored hate, exhilarant disdain.<br/>
My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated,<br/>
Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested,<br/>
And all of life for all mankind created<br/>
Shall be within mine inmost being tested:<br/>
The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow,<br/>
Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow,<br/>
And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded,<br/>
I too, at last, shall with them all be stranded!<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, who for many a thousand year<br/>
The same tough meat have chewed and tested,<br/>
That from the cradle to the bier<br/>
No man the ancient leaven has digested!<br/>
Trust one of us, this Whole supernal<br/>
Is made but for a God's delight!<br/>
<i>He</i> dwells in splendor single and eternal,<br/>
But <i>us</i> he thrusts in darkness, out of sight,<br/>
And <i>you</i> he dowers with Day and Night.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
Nay, but I will!<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
A good reply!<br/>
One only fear still needs repeating:<br/>
The art is long, the time is fleeting.<br/>
Then let thyself be taught, say I!<br/>
Go, league thyself with a poet,<br/>
Give the rein to his imagination,<br/>
Then wear the crown, and show it,<br/>
Of the qualities of his creation,—<br/>
The courage of the lion's breed,<br/>
The wild stag's speed,<br/>
The Italian's fiery blood,<br/>
The North's firm fortitude!<br/>
Let him find for thee the secret tether<br/>
That binds the Noble and Mean together.<br/>
And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure<br/>
To love by rule, and hate by measure!<br/>
I'd like, myself, such a one to see:<br/>
Sir Microcosm his name should be.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
What am I, then, if 'tis denied my part<br/>
The crown of all humanity to win me,<br/>
Whereto yearns every sense within me?<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Why, on the whole, thou'rt—what thou art.<br/>
Set wigs of million curls upon thy head, to raise thee,<br/>
Wear shoes an ell in height,—the truth betrays thee,<br/>
And thou remainest—what thou art.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure<br/>
Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain;<br/>
And if I now sit down in restful leisure,<br/>
No fount of newer strength is in my brain:<br/>
I am no hair's-breadth more in height,<br/>
Nor nearer, to the Infinite,<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Good Sir, you see the facts precisely<br/>
As they are seen by each and all.<br/>
We must arrange them now, more wisely,<br/>
Before the joys of life shall pall.<br/>
Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly—<br/>
And head and virile forces—thine:<br/>
Yet all that I indulge in newly,<br/>
Is't thence less wholly mine?<br/>
If I've six stallions in my stall,<br/>
Are not their forces also lent me?<br/>
I speed along, completest man of all,<br/>
As though my legs were four-and-twenty.<br/>
Take hold, then! let reflection rest,<br/>
And plunge into the world with zest!<br/>
I say to thee, a speculative wight<br/>
Is like a beast on moorlands lean,<br/>
That round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight,<br/>
While all about lie pastures fresh and green.<br/>
<br/>
FAUST<br/>
<br/>
Then how shall we begin?<br/>

MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/></p>
<div class="indentedss">We'll try a wider sphere.<br/></div>
<p>What place of martyrdom is here!<br/>
Is't life, I ask, is't even prudence,<br/>
To bore thyself and bore the students?<br/>
Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend!<br/>
Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever?<br/>
The best thou learnest, in the end<br/>
Thou dar'st not tell the youngsters—never!<br/>
I hear one's footsteps, hither steering.<br/>

FAUST<br/>
To see him now I have no heart.<br/>

So long the poor boy waits a hearing,<br/>

Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me!<br/>
I'll play the comedy with art.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My wits, be certain, will befriend me.<br/>
But fifteen minutes' time is all I need;<br/>

<br/>
Reason and Knowledge only thou despise,<br/>
The highest strength in man that lies!<br/>
Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee<br/>
With magic works and shows that blind thee,<br/>
And I shall have thee fast and sure!—<br/>
Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him,<br/>
As forwards, onwards, ever must endure;<br/>
Whose over-hasty impulse drave him<br/>
Past earthly joys he might secure.<br/>
Dragged through the wildest life, will I enslave him,<br/>
Through flat and stale indifference;<br/>
With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him<br/>
That, to his hot, insatiate sense,<br/>
The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him:<br/>
Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore—<br/>
Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save him,<br/>
Still were he lost forevermore!<br/>
<br/>
(<i>A</i> STUDENT <i>enters</i>.)<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
A short time, only, am I here,<br/>
And come, devoted and sincere,<br/>
To greet and know the man of fame,<br/>
Whom men to me with reverence name.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Your courtesy doth flatter me:<br/>
You see a man, as others be.<br/>
Have you, perchance, elsewhere begun?<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
Receive me now, I pray, as one<br/>
Who comes to you with courage good,<br/>
Somewhat of cash, and healthy blood:<br/>
My mother was hardly willing to let me;<br/>
But knowledge worth having I fain would get me.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Then you have reached the right place now.<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to leave it, I must avow;<br/>
I find these walls, these vaulted spaces<br/>
Are anything but pleasant places.<br/>
Tis all so cramped and close and mean;<br/>
One sees no tree, no glimpse of green,<br/>
And when the lecture-halls receive me,<br/>
Seeing, hearing, and thinking leave me.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
All that depends on habitude.<br/>
So from its mother's breasts a child<br/>
At first, reluctant, takes its food,<br/>
But soon to seek them is beguiled.<br/>
Thus, at the breasts of Wisdom clinging,<br/>
Thou'lt find each day a greater rapture bringing.<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
I'll hang thereon with joy, and freely drain them;<br/>
But tell me, pray, the proper means to gain them.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Explain, before you further speak,<br/>
The special faculty you seek.<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
I crave the highest erudition;<br/>
And fain would make my acquisition<br/>
All that there is in Earth and Heaven,<br/>
In Nature and in Science too.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Here is the genuine path for you;<br/>
Yet strict attention must be given.<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
Body and soul thereon I'll wreak;<br/>
Yet, truly, I've some inclination<br/>
On summer holidays to seek<br/>
A little freedom and recreation.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Use well your time! It flies so swiftly from us;<br/>
But time through order may be won, I promise.<br/>
So, Friend (my views to briefly sum),<br/>
First, the <i>collegium logicum</i>.<br/>
There will your mind be drilled and braced,<br/>
As if in Spanish boots 'twere laced,<br/>
And thus, to graver paces brought,<br/>
'Twill plod along the path of thought,<br/>
Instead of shooting here and there,<br/>
A will-o'-the-wisp in murky air.<br/>
Days will be spent to bid you know,<br/>
What once you did at a single blow,<br/>
Like eating and drinking, free and strong,—<br/>
That one, two, three! thereto belong.<br/>
Truly the fabric of mental fleece<br/>
Resembles a weaver's masterpiece,<br/>
Where a thousand threads one treadle throws,<br/>
Where fly the shuttles hither and thither.<br/>
Unseen the threads are knit together.<br/>
And an infinite combination grows.<br/>
Then, the philosopher steps in<br/>
And shows, no otherwise it could have been:<br/>
The first was so, the second so,<br/>
Therefore the third and fourth are so;<br/>
Were not the first and second, then<br/>
The third and fourth had never been.<br/>
The scholars are everywhere believers,<br/>
But never succeed in being weavers.<br/>
He who would study organic existence,<br/>
First drives out the soul with rigid persistence;<br/>
Then the parts in his hand he may hold and class,<br/>
But the spiritual link is lost, alas!<br/>
<i>Encheiresin natures</i>, this Chemistry names,<br/>
Nor knows how herself she banters and blames!<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
I cannot understand you quite.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Your mind will shortly be set aright,<br/>
When you have learned, all things reducing,<br/>
To classify them for your using.<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
I feel as stupid, from all you've said,<br/>
As if a mill-wheel whirled in my head!<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
And after—first and foremost duty—Of<br/>
Metaphysics learn the use and beauty!<br/>
See that you most profoundly gain<br/>
What does not suit the human brain!<br/>
A splendid word to serve, you'll find<br/>
For what goes in—or won't go in—your mind.<br/>
But first, at least this half a year,<br/>
To order rigidly adhere;<br/>
Five hours a day, you understand,<br/>
And when the clock strikes, be on hand!<br/>
Prepare beforehand for your part<br/>
With paragraphs all got by heart,<br/>
So you can better watch, and look<br/>
That naught is said but what is in the book:<br/>
Yet in thy writing as unwearied be,<br/>
As did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee!<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
No need to tell me twice to do it!<br/>
I think, how useful 'tis to write;<br/>
For what one has, in black and white,<br/>
One carries home and then goes through it.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Yet choose thyself a faculty!<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
I cannot reconcile myself to Jurisprudence.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Nor can I therefore greatly blame you students:<br/>
I know what science this has come to be.<br/>
All rights and laws are still transmitted<br/>
Like an eternal sickness of the race,—<br/>
From generation unto generation fitted,<br/>
And shifted round from place to place.<br/>
Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry:<br/>
Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee!<br/>
The right born with us, ours in verity,<br/>
This to consider, there's, alas! no hurry.<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
My own disgust is strengthened by your speech:<br/>
O lucky he, whom you shall teach!<br/>
I've almost for Theology decided.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
I should not wish to see you here misguided:<br/>
For, as regards this science, let me hint<br/>
'Tis very hard to shun the false direction;<br/>
There's so much secret poison lurking in 't,<br/>
So like the medicine, it baffles your detection.<br/>
Hear, therefore, one alone, for that is best, in sooth,<br/>
And simply take your master's words for truth.<br/>
On <i>words</i> let your attention centre!<br/>
Then through the safest gate you'll enter<br/>
The temple-halls of Certainty.<br/>
<br/>
STUDENT<br/>
<br/>
Yet in the word must some idea be.<br/>
<br/>
MEPHISTOPHELES<br/>
<br/>
Of course! But only shun too over-sharp a tension,<br/>
For just where fails the comprehension,<br/>

Pardon! With many questions I detain you.<br/>
Yet must I trouble you again.<br/>
Of Medicine I still would fain<br/>
Hear one strong word that might explain you.<br/>
Three years is but a little space.<br/>

'Twere easier groping forward, truly.<br/>

To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy:<br/>
Learn of the great and little world your fill,<br/>
To let it go at last, so please ye,<br/>
Just as God will!<br/>
In vain that through the realms of science you may drift;<br/>
Each one learns only—just what learn he can:<br/>
Yet he who grasps the Moment's gift,<br/>
He is the proper man.<br/>
Well-made you are, 'tis not to be denied,<br/>
The rest a bold address will win you;<br/>
If you but in yourself confide,<br/>
At once confide all others in you.<br/>
To lead the women, learn the special feeling!<br/>
Their everlasting aches and groans,<br/>
In thousand tones,<br/>
Have all one source, one mode of healing;<br/>
And if your acts are half discreet,<br/>
You'll always have them at your feet.<br/>
A title first must draw and interest them,<br/>
And show that yours all other arts exceeds;<br/>
Then, as a greeting, you are free to touch and test them,<br/>
While, thus to do, for years another pleads.<br/>
You press and count the pulse's dances,<br/>
And then, with burning sidelong glances,<br/>
You clasp the swelling hips, to see<br/>
If tightly laced her corsets be.<br/>
