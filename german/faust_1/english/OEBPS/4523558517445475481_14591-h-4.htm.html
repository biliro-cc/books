I want his death in the weekly paper stated.<br/>

<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Yes, my good dame, a pair of witnesses<br/>

<p>How is it? under way? and soon complete?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Ah, bravo! Do I find you burning?<br/>
Well, Margaret soon will still your yearning:<br/>
At Neighbor Martha's you'll this evening meet.<br/>
A fitter woman ne'er was made<br/>
To ply the pimp and gypsy trade!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Tis well.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

<p>FAUST</p>
<p>One service pays the other thus.</p>

<p>We've but to make a deposition valid<br/>
That now her husband's limbs, outstretched and pallid,<br/>
At Padua rest, in consecrated soil.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Most wise! And first, of course, we'll make the journey<br/>
thither?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p><i>Sancta simplicitas</i>! no need of such a toil;<br/>
Depose, with knowledge or without it, either!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>If you've naught better, then, I'll tear your pretty plan!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Now, there you are! O holy man!<br/>
Is it the first time in your life you're driven<br/>
To bear false witness in a case?<br/>
Of God, the world and all that in it has a place,<br/>
Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race,<br/>
Have you not terms and definitions given<br/>
With brazen forehead, daring breast?<br/>
And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly,<br/>
Knew you so much—and you'll confess it roundly!—<br/>
As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist, liar.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Yes, knew I not more deeply thy desire.<br/>
For wilt thou not, no lover fairer,<br/>
Poor Margaret flatter, and ensnare her,<br/>
And all thy soul's devotion swear her?</p>

<p>And from my heart.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<div class="indenteds">
<p>'Tis very fine!<br/></p>

<p>Thine endless love, thy faith assuring,<br/>
The one almighty force enduring,—<br/>
Will that, too, prompt this heart of thine?<br/>

<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Hold! hold! It will!—If such my flame,<br/>
And for the sense and power intense<br/>
I seek, and cannot find, a name;<br/>
Then range with all my senses through creation,<br/>
Craving the speech of inspiration,<br/>
And call this ardor, so supernal,<br/>
Endless, eternal and eternal,—<br/>
Is that a devilish lying game?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>And yet I'm right!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>

Intends to have the right, if but his<br/>

Will have it, certainly.<br/>
But come: the further talking brings<br/>
<span class="c8">disgust,</span><br/>

<p>(MARGARET <i>on</i> FAUST'S <i>arm</i>. MARTHA <i>and</i> MEPHISTOPHELES <i>walking up and down</i>.)</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>I feel, the gentleman allows for me,<br/>
Demeans himself, and shames me by it;<br/>
A traveller is so used to be<br/>
Kindly content with any diet.<br/>
I know too well that my poor gossip can<br/>
Ne'er entertain such an experienced man.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>A look from thee, a word, more entertains<br/>
Than all the lore of wisest brains.</p>
<p>(<i>He kisses her hand</i>.)</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Don't incommode yourself! How could you ever kiss it!<br/>
It is so ugly, rough to see!<br/>
What work I do,—how hard and steady is it!<br/>
Mother is much too close with me.</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>[<i>They pass</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>And you, Sir, travel always, do you not?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Alas, that trade and duty us so harry!<br/>
With what a pang one leaves so many a spot,<br/>
And dares not even now and then to tarry!</p>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>In young, wild years it suits your ways,<br/>
This round and round the world in freedom sweeping;<br/>
But then come on the evil days,<br/>
And so, as bachelor, into his grave a-creeping,<br/>
None ever found a thing to praise.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I dread to see how such a fate advances.</p>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>Then, worthy Sir, improve betimes your chances!</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>[<i>They pass</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Yes, out of sight is out of mind!<br/>
Your courtesy an easy grace is;<br/>
But you have friends in other places,<br/>
And sensibler than I, you'll find.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Trust me, dear heart! what men call sensible<br/>
Is oft mere vanity and narrowness.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>How so?</p>
</div>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Ah, that simplicity and innocence ne'er know<br/>
Themselves, their holy value, and their spell!<br/>
That meekness, lowliness, the highest graces<br/>
Which Nature portions out so lovingly—</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>So you but think a moment's space on me,<br/>
All times I'll have to think on you, all places!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>No doubt you're much alone?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Yes, for our household small has grown,<br/>
Yet must be cared for, you will own.<br/>
We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping,<br/>
The cooking, early work and late, in fact;<br/>
And mother, in her notions of housekeeping,<br/>
Is so exact!<br/>
Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down:<br/>
We, more than others, might take comfort, rather:<br/>
A nice estate was left us by my father,<br/>
A house, a little garden near the town.<br/>
But now my days have less of noise and hurry;<br/>
My brother is a soldier,<br/>
My little sister's dead.<br/>
True, with the child a troubled life I led,<br/>
Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry,<br/>
So very dear was she.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>An angel, if like thee!</p>
</div>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>I brought it up, and it was fond of me.<br/>
Father had died before it saw the light,<br/>
And mother's case seemed hopeless quite,<br/>
So weak and miserable she lay;<br/>
And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day.<br/>
She could not think, herself, of giving<br/>
The poor wee thing its natural living;<br/>
And so I nursed it all alone<br/>
With milk and water: 'twas my own.<br/>
Lulled in my lap with many a song,<br/>
It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>The purest bliss was surely then thy dower.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>But surely, also, many a weary hour.<br/>
I kept the baby's cradle near<br/>
My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it,<br/>
And waking, hear.<br/>
And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it,<br/>
And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake,<br/>
And dandling back and forth the restless creature take,<br/>
Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break;<br/>
And then the marketing and kitchen-tending,<br/>
Day after day, the same thing, never-ending.<br/>
One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good,<br/>
But then one learns to relish rest and food.</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>[<i>They pass</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>Yes, the poor women are bad off, 'tis true:<br/>
A stubborn bachelor there's no converting.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>It but depends upon the like of you,<br/>
And I should turn to better ways than flirting.</p>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>Speak plainly, Sir, have you no one detected?<br/>
Has not your heart been anywhere subjected?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>The proverb says: One's own warm hearth<br/>
And a good wife, are gold and jewels worth.</p>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>I mean, have you not felt desire, though ne'er so slightly?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I've everywhere, in fact, been entertained politely.</p>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p>I meant to say, were you not touched in earnest, ever?</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>One should allow one's self to jest with ladies never.</p>
<p>MARTHA Ah, you don't understand!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>I'm sorry I'm so blind: But I am sure—that you are very kind.</p>
<div class="indentedss">

<p>And me, thou angel! didst thou recognize,<br/>
As through the garden-gate I came?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Did you not see it? I cast down my eyes.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>And thou forgiv'st my freedom, and the blame<br/>
To my impertinence befitting,<br/>
As the Cathedral thou wert quitting?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>I was confused, the like ne'er happened me;<br/>
No one could ever speak to my discredit.<br/>
Ah, thought I, in my conduct has he read it—<br/>
Something immodest or unseemly free?<br/>
He seemed to have the sudden feeling<br/>
That with this wench 'twere very easy dealing.<br/>
I will confess, I knew not what appeal<br/>
On your behalf, here, in my bosom grew;<br/>
But I was angry with myself, to feel<br/>
That I could not be angrier with you.</p>

Let this warm clasp of hands declare thee<br/>
What is unspeakable!<br/>

<p>FOREST AND CAVERN</p>
<p>FAUST (<i>solus</i>)</p>
<p>Spirit sublime, thou gav'st me, gav'st me all<br/>
For which I prayed. Not unto me in vain<br/>
Hast thou thy countenance revealed in fire.<br/>
Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grand,<br/>
With power to feel and to enjoy it. Thou<br/>
Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield'st,<br/>
But grantest, that in her profoundest breast<br/>
I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend.<br/>
The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead<br/>
Before me, teaching me to know my brothers<br/>
In air and water and the silent wood.<br/>
And when the storm in forests roars and grinds,<br/>
The giant firs, in falling, neighbor boughs<br/>
And neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear down,<br/>
And falling, fill the hills with hollow thunders,—<br/>
Then to the cave secure thou leadest me,<br/>
Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast<br/>
The deep, mysterious miracles unfold.<br/>
And when the perfect moon before my gaze<br/>
Comes up with soothing light, around me float<br/>
From every precipice and thicket damp<br/>
The silvery phantoms of the ages past,<br/>
And temper the austere delight of thought.</p>
<p>That nothing can be perfect unto Man<br/>
I now am conscious. With this ecstasy,<br/>
Which brings me near and nearer to the Gods,<br/>
Thou gav'st the comrade, whom I now no more<br/>
Can do without, though, cold and scornful, he<br/>
Demeans me to myself, and with a breath,<br/>
A word, transforms thy gifts to nothingness.<br/>
Within my breast he fans a lawless fire,<br/>
Unwearied, for that fair and lovely form:<br/>
Thus in desire I hasten to enjoyment,<br/>
And in enjoyment pine to feel desire.</p>

To plague my day auspicious thou returnest.</p>

<p>There is, again, thy proper tone!—<br/>
That thou hast bored me, I must thankful be!</p>

<p>Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone<br/>
Have led thy life, bereft of me?<br/>
I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure;<br/>
Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all:<br/>
Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure,<br/>
Walked thyself off this earthly ball<br/>
Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking,<br/>
Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking?<br/>
Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone,<br/>
Toad-like, thy nourishment alone?<br/>
A fine way, this, thy time to fill!<br/>
The Doctor's in thy body still.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>What fresh and vital forces, canst thou guess,<br/>
Spring from my commerce with the wilderness?<br/>
But, if thou hadst the power of guessing,<br/>
Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing.</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains!<br/>
In night and dew to lie upon the mountains;<br/>
All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating;<br/>
Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating;<br/>
To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow,<br/>
Compress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow,—<br/>
To taste, I know not what, in haughty power,<br/>
Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower,<br/>
Thine earthly self behind thee cast,<br/>
And then the lofty instinct, thus—</p>

<p>Yes, thou findest that unpleasant!<br/>
Thou hast the moral right to cry me "shame!" at present.<br/>
One dares not that before chaste ears declare,<br/>
Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare;<br/>
And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure<br/>
Of lying to thyself in moderate measure.<br/>
But such a course thou wilt not long endure;<br/>
Already art thou o'er-excited,<br/>
And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted<br/>
To madness and to horror, sure.<br/>
Enough of that! Thy love sits lonely yonder,<br/>
By all things saddened and oppressed;<br/>
Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,—<br/>
mighty love is in her breast.<br/>
First came thy passion's flood and poured around her<br/>
As when from melted snow a streamlet overflows;<br/>
Thou hast therewith so filled and drowned her,<br/>
That now <i>thy</i> stream all shallow shows.<br/>
Methinks, instead of in the forests lording,<br/>
The noble Sir should find it good,<br/>
The love of this young silly blood<br/>
At once to set about rewarding.<br/>
Her time is miserably long;<br/>
She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray<br/>
O'er the old city-wall, and far away.<br/>
"Were I a little bird!" so runs her song,<br/>
Day long, and half night long.<br/>
Now she is lively, mostly sad,<br/>
Now, wept beyond her tears;<br/>
Then again quiet she appears,—Always<br/>
love-mad.</p>

<p>What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown;<br/>
And half and half thou art, I own.</p>

Though I were ne'er so far, it cannot falter:<br/>

Go on! It is a woe profound!<br/>
'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're bound,<br/>
And not for death, indeed.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>What are, within her arms, the heavenly blisses?<br/>
Though I be glowing with her kisses,<br/>
Do I not always share her need?<br/>
I am the fugitive, all houseless roaming,<br/>
The monster without air or rest,<br/>
That like a cataract, down rocks and gorges foaming,<br/>
Leaps, maddened, into the abyss's breast!<br/>
And side-wards she, with young unwakened senses,<br/>
Within her cabin on the Alpine field<br/>
Her simple, homely life commences,<br/>
Her little world therein concealed.<br/>
And I, God's hate flung o'er me,<br/>
Had not enough, to thrust<br/>
The stubborn rocks before me<br/>
And strike them into dust!<br/>
She and her peace I yet must undermine:<br/>
Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine!<br/>
Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me;<br/>
What must be, let it quickly be!<br/>
Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,—<br/>
One ruin whelm both her and me!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>
<p>Again it seethes, again it glows!<br/>
Thou fool, go in and comfort her!<br/>
When such a head as thine no outlet knows,<br/>
It thinks the end must soon occur.<br/>
Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind!<br/>
Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear:<br/>
Naught so insipid in the world I find<br/>
As is a devil in despair.</p>

<p>Promise me, Henry!—</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>What I can!</p>
</div>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>How is't with thy religion, pray?<br/>
Thou art a dear, good-hearted man,<br/>
And yet, I think, dost not incline that way.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Leave that, my child! Thou know'st my love is tender;<br/>
For love, my blood and life would I surrender,<br/>
And as for Faith and Church, I grant to each his own.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>That's not enough: we must believe thereon.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Must we?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<div class="indented">
<p>Would that I had some influence!</p>
</div>
<p>Then, too, thou honorest not the Holy Sacraments.<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>I honor them.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<div class="indenteds">
<p>Desiring no possession<br/></p>

<div class="indentedss">
<p>My darling, who shall dare<br/></p>
</div>
<p>"I believe in God!" to say?<br/>
Ask priest or sage the answer to declare,<br/>
And it will seem a mocking play,<br/>
A sarcasm on the asker.<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>Then thou believest not!</p>
</div>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Hear me not falsely, sweetest countenance!<br/>
Who dare express Him?<br/>
And who profess Him,<br/>
Saying: I believe in Him!<br/>
Who, feeling, seeing,<br/>
Deny His being,<br/>
Saying: I believe Him not!<br/>
The All-enfolding,<br/>
The All-upholding,<br/>
Folds and upholds he not<br/>
Thee, me, Himself?<br/>
Arches not there the sky above us?<br/>
Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth?<br/>
And rise not, on us shining,<br/>
Friendly, the everlasting stars?<br/>
Look I not, eye to eye, on thee,<br/>
And feel'st not, thronging<br/>
To head and heart, the force,<br/>
Still weaving its eternal secret,<br/>
Invisible, visible, round thy life?<br/>
Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart,<br/>
And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art,<br/>
Call it, then, what thou wilt,—<br/>
Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!<br/>
I have no name to give it!<br/>
Feeling is all in all:<br/>
The Name is sound and smoke,<br/>
Obscuring Heaven's clear glow.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>All that is fine and good, to hear it so:<br/>
Much the same way the preacher spoke,<br/>
Only with slightly different phrases.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>The same thing, in all places,<br/>
All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day—<br/>
Each in its language—say;<br/>
Then why not I, in mine, as well?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>To hear it thus, it may seem passable;<br/>
And yet, some hitch in't there must be<br/>
For thou hast no Christianity.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Dear love!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>I've long been grieved to see<br/>
That thou art in such company.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<div class="indentedss">
<p>The man who with thee goes, thy mate,<br/></p>
</div>
<p>Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate.<br/>
In all my life there's nothing<br/>

As his repulsive face has done.<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Nay, fear him not, my sweetest one!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>I feel his presence like something ill.<br/>
I've else, for all, a kindly will,<br/>
But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth,<br/>
The secret horror of him returneth;<br/>
And I think the man a knave, as I live!<br/>
If I do him wrong, may God forgive!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>There must be such queer birds, however.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Live with the like of him, may I never!<br/>
When once inside the door comes he,<br/>
He looks around so sneeringly,<br/>
And half in wrath:<br/>
One sees that in nothing no interest he hath:<br/>
'Tis written on his very forehead<br/>
That love, to him, is a thing abhorréd.<br/>
I am so happy on thine arm,<br/>
So free, so yielding, and so warm,<br/>
And in his presence stifled seems my heart.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Foreboding angel that thou art!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>It overcomes me in such degree,<br/>
That wheresoe'er he meets us, even,<br/>
I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee.<br/>
When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven.<br/>
That burns within me like a flame,<br/>
And surely, Henry, 'tis with thee the same.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>There, now, is thine antipathy!</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>But I must go.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<div class="indenteds">
<p>Ah, shall there never be<br/></p>
</div>
<p>A quiet hour, to see us fondly plighted,<br/>
With breast to breast, and soul to soul united?<br/>
<br/></p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Ah, if I only slept alone!<br/>
I'd draw the bolts to-night, for thy desire;<br/>
But mother's sleep so light has grown,<br/>
And if we were discovered by her,<br/>
'Twould be my death upon the spot!</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Thou angel, fear it not!<br/>
Here is a phial: in her drink<br/>
But three drops of it measure,<br/>
And deepest sleep will on her senses sink.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>What would I not, to give thee pleasure?<br/>
It will not harm her, when one tries it?</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>If 'twould, my love, would I advise it?</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<p>Ah, dearest man, if but thy face I see,<br/>
I know not what compels me to thy will:<br/>
So much have I already done for thee,<br/>
That scarcely more is left me to fulfil.</p>

<p>I've heard, most fully, how she drew thee.<br/>

The girls have much desire to ascertain<br/>
If one is prim and good, as ancient rules compel:<br/>
If there he's led, they think, he'll follow them as well.</p>
<p>FAUST</p>
<p>Thou, monster, wilt nor see nor own<br/>
How this pure soul, of faith so lowly,<br/>
So loving and ineffable,—<br/>
The faith alone<br/>
That her salvation is,—with scruples holy<br/>
Pines, lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well!</p>
<p>MEPHISTOPHELES</p>

<p>And then, how masterly she reads physiognomy!<br/>
When I am present she's impressed, she knows not how;<br/>
She in my mask a hidden sense would read:<br/>
She feels that surely I'm a genius now,—<br/>
Perhaps the very Devil, indeed!<br/>

She clung to the fellow so long and tightly!<br/>
That was a promenading!<br/>
At village and dance parading!<br/>
As the first they must everywhere shine,<br/>
And he treated her always to pies and wine,<br/>
And she made a to-do with her face so fine;<br/>
So mean and shameless was her behavior,<br/>
