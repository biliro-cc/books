  <body class="x-ebookmaker"><p id="id01372">3. In Ansehung der Methode. Wenn man etwas Methode nennen soll, so
muß es ein Verfahren nach Grundsätzen sein. Nun kann man die jetzt
in diesem Fache der Naturforschung herrschende Methode in die
naturalistische und szientifische einteilen. Der Naturalist der reinen
Vernunft nimmt es sich zum Grundsatze: daß durch gemeine Vernunft ohne
Wissenschaft (welche er die gesunde Vernunft nennt) sich in Ansehung
der erhabensten Fragen, die die Aufgabe der Metaphysik ausmachen, mehr
ausrichten lasse, als durch Spekulation. Er behauptet also, daß man
die Größe und Weite des Mondes sicherer nach dem Augenmaße, als durch
mathematische Umschweife bestimmen könne. Es ist bloße Misologie,
auf Grundsätze gebracht, und, welches das ungereimteste ist, die
Vernachlässigung aller künstlichen Mittel, als eine eigene Methode
angerühmt, seine Erkenntnis zu erweitern. Denn was die Naturalisten
aus Mangel mehrerer Einsicht betrifft, so kann man ihnen mit Grunde
nichts zur Last legen. Sie folgen der gemeinen Vernunft, ohne sich
ihrer Unwissenheit als einer Methode zu rühmen, die das Geheimnis
enthalten solle, die Wahrheit aus Demokrits tiefem Brunnen
herauszuholen. Quod sapio, satis est mihi; non ego curo, esse quod
Arcesilas aerumnosique Solones, Pers. ist ihr Wahlspruch, bei dem
sie vergnügt und beifallswürdig leben können, ohne sich um die
Wissenschaft zu bekümmern, noch deren Geschäft zu verwirren.</p>

<p id="id01373">Was nun die Beobachter einer szientifischen Methode betrifft, so haben
sie hier die Wahl, entweder dogmatisch oder skeptisch, in allen Fällen
aber doch die Verbindlichkeit systematisch zu verfahren. Wenn ich hier
in Ansehung der ersteren den berühmten Wolf, bei der zweiten David
Hume nenne, so kann ich die übrigen, meiner jetzigen Absicht nach,
ungenannt lassen. Der kritische Weg ist allein noch offen. Wenn der
Leser diesen in meiner Gesellschaft durchzuwandern Gefälligkeit
und Geduld gehabt hat, so mag er jetzt urteilen, ob nicht, wenn es
ihm beliebt, das Seinige dazu beizutragen, um diesen Fußsteig zur
Heeresstraße zu machen, dasjenige, was viele Jahrhunderte nicht
leisten konnten, noch vor Ablauf des gegenwärtigen erreicht werden
möge: nämlich, die menschliche Vernunft in dem, was ihre Wißbegierde
jederzeit, bisher aber vergeblich, beschäftigt hat, zur völligen
Befriedigung zu bringen.</p>

<p id="id01376">Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id01377">We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.</p>

<p id="id01378">Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.</p>

<p id="id01379">Most people start at our Web sites at:
https://gutenberg.org or
http://promo.net/pg</p>

<p id="id01380">These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).</p>

<p id="id01381" style="margin-top: 2em">Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.</p>

<p id="id01385" style="margin-top: 2em">Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)</p>

<p id="id01386">We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.</p>

<p id="id01387">The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.</p>
