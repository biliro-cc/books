<p class="p2 c9">OF THE POVERTY OF THE RICHEST<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ten years passed by—<br/>
Not a drop reached me,<br/>
No rain-fraught wind, no dew of love<br/>
—A rainless land....<br/>
Now entreat I my wisdom<br/>
Not to become stingy in this drought;<br/>
Overflow thyself, trickle thy dew,<br/>
Be thyself the rain of the parched wilderness!<br/>
<br/>
I once bade the clouds<br/>
Depart from my mountains;<br/>
Once I said to them,<br/>
"More light, ye dark ones!"<br/>
To-day I entice them to come:<br/>
Make me dark with your udders:<br/>
—I would milk you,<br/>
Ye cows of the heights!<br/>
Milk-warm wisdom, sweet dew of love<br/>
I pour over the land.<br/>
<br/>
Away, away, ye truths<br/>
That look so gloomy!<br/>
I will not have on my mountains<br/>
<a id="Page_176" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 176]"></a>Bitter, impatient truths.<br/>
May truth approach me to-day<br/>
Gilded by smiles,<br/>
Sweetened by the sun, browned by love,—<br/>
A ripe truth I would fain break off from the tree.<br/>
<br/>
To-day I stretch my hands<br/>
Toward the tresses of chance,<br/>
Wise enough to lead,<br/>
To outwit chance like a child.<br/>
To-day I will be hospitable<br/>
'Gainst the unwelcome,<br/>
'Gainst destiny itself I will not be prickly....<br/>
—Zarathustra is no hedgehog.<br/>
<br/>
My soul,<br/>
Insatiable with its tongue,<br/>
Has already tasted of all things good and evil,<br/>
And has dived into all depths.<br/>
But ever, like the cork,<br/>
It swims to the surface again,<br/>
And floats like oil upon brown seas:<br/>
Because of this soul men call me fortunate.<br/>
<br/>
Who are my father and mother?<br/>
Is not my father Prince Plenty?<br/>
And my mother Silent Laughter?<br/>
Did not the union of these two<br/>
Beget me, the enigmatic beast—<br/>
Me, the monster of light—<br/>
Me, Zarathustra, the squanderer of all wisdom?<br/>
<br/>
Sick to-day from tenderness,<br/>
<a id="Page_177" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 177]"></a>A dewy wind,<br/>
Zarathustra sits waiting, waiting on his mountains—<br/>
Sweet and stewing<br/>
In his own juice,<br/>
Beneath his own summit,<br/>
Beneath his ice,<br/>
Weary and happy,<br/>
A Creator on his seventh day.<br/>
<br/>
—Silence!<br/>
A truth passes over me<br/>
Like a cloud,—<br/>
With invisible lightnings it strikes me,<br/>
On broad, slow stairs,<br/>
Its happiness climbs to me:<br/>
Come, come, beloved truth!<br/>
<br/>
—Silence!<br/>
'Tis <i>my</i> truth!<br/>
From timid eyes,<br/>
From velvet shudders,<br/>
Her glance meets mine,<br/>
Sweet and wicked, a maiden's glance.<br/>
She has guessed the reason of my happiness,<br/>
She has guessed me—ha! what is she thinking?<br/>
A purple dragon<br/>
Lurks in the abyss of her maiden's glance.<br/>
<br/>
—Silence! My truth is speaking!—<br/>
<br/>
"Woe to thee, Zarathustra!<br/>
Thou lookest like one<br/>
That hath swallowed gold:<br/>
<a id="Page_178" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 178]"></a>They will slit up thy belly yet!<br/>
<br/>
Thou art too rich,<br/>
Thou corrupter of many!<br/>
Thou makest too many jealous,<br/>
Too many poor....<br/>
Even on me thy light casts a shadow—<br/>
I feel chill: go away, thou rich one<br/>
Go away, Zarathustra, from the path of thy sun<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BETWEEN BIRDS OF PREY<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who would here descend,<br/>
How soon<br/>
Is he swallowed up by the depths!<br/>
But thou, Zarathustra,<br/>
Still lovest the abysses,<br/>
Lovest them as doth the fir tree!<br/>
<br/>
The fir flings its roots<br/>
Where the rock itself gazes<br/>
Shuddering at the depths,—<br/>
The fir pauses before the abysses<br/>
Where all around<br/>
Would fain descend:<br/>
Amid the impatience<br/>
Of wild, rolling, leaping torrents<br/>
It waits so patient, stern and silent,<br/>
Lonely....<br/>
<br/>
Lonely!<br/>
Who would venture<br/>
Here to be guest—<br/>
<a id="Page_179" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 179]"></a>To be thy guest?<br/>
<br/>
A bird of prey, perchance<br/>
Joyous at others' misfortune,<br/>
Will cling persistent<br/>
To the hair of the steadfast watcher,<br/>
With frenzied laughter,<br/>
A vulture's laughter....<br/>
<br/>
Wherefore so steadfast?<br/>
—Mocks he so cruel:<br/>
He must have wings, who loves the abyss,<br/>
He must not stay on the cliff,<br/>
As thou who hangest there!—<br/>
<br/>
O Zarathustra,<br/>
Cruellest Nimrod!<br/>
Of late still a hunter of God,<br/>
A spider's web to capture virtue,<br/>
An arrow of evil!<br/>
Now<br/>
Hunted by thyself,<br/>
Thine own prey<br/>
Caught in the grip of thine own soul.<br/>
<br/>
Now<br/>
Lonely to me and thee,<br/>
Twofold in thine own knowledge,<br/>
Mid a hundred mirrors<br/>
False to thyself,<br/>
Mid a hundred memories<br/>
Uncertain,<br/>
Weary at every wound,<br/>
Shivering at every frost,<br/>
Throttled in thine own noose,<br/>
Self-knower!<br/>
<a id="Page_180" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 180]"></a>Self-hangman!<br/>
<br/>
Why didst bind thyself<br/>
With the noose of thy wisdom?<br/>
Why luredst thyself<br/>
Into the old serpent's paradise?<br/>
Why stolest into<br/>
Thyself, thyself?...<br/>
<br/>
A sick man now,<br/>
Sick of serpent's poison,<br/>
A captive now<br/>
Who hast drawn the hardest lot:<br/>
In thine own shaft<br/>
Bowed as thou workest,<br/>
In thine own cavern<br/>
Digging at thyself,<br/>
Helpless quite,<br/>
Stiff,<br/>
A cold corse<br/>
Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens,<br/>
Overburdened by thyself,<br/>
A knower!<br/>
A self-knower!<br/>
The wise Zarathustra!...<br/>
<br/>
Thou soughtest the heaviest burden,<br/>
So foundest thou thyself,<br/>
And canst not shake thyself off....<br/>
<br/>
Watching,<br/>
Chewing,<br/>
One that stands upright no more!<br/>
Thou wilt grow deformed even in thy grave,<br/>
<a id="Page_181" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 181]"></a>Deformed spirit!<br/>
<br/>
And of late still so proud<br/>
On all the stilts of thy pride!<br/>
Of late still the godless hermit,<br/>
The hermit with one comrade—the devil,<br/>
The scarlet prince of every devilment!...<br/>
<br/>
Now—<br/>
Between two nothings<br/>
Huddled up,<br/>
A question-mark,<br/>
A weary riddle,<br/>
A riddle for vultures....<br/>
They will "solve" thee,<br/>
They hunger already for thy "solution,"<br/>
They flutter already about their "riddle,"<br/>
About thee, the doomed one!<br/>
O Zarathustra,<br/>
Self-knower!<br/>
<a id="Page_182" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 182]"></a>Self-hangman!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE SUN SINKS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Not much longer thirstest thou,<br/>
O burnt-up heart!<br/>
Promise is in the air,<br/>
From unknown mouths I feel a breath,<br/>
—The great coolness comes....<br/>
My sun stood hot above me at noonday:<br/>
A greeting to you that are coming,<br/>
Ye sudden winds,<br/>
Ye cool spirits of afternoon!<br/>
<br/>
The air is strange and pure.<br/>
See how the night<br/>
Leers at me with eyes askance,<br/>
Like a seducer!...<br/>
Be strong, my brave heart,<br/>
And ask not "Why?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
<br/>
The day of my life!<br/>
The sun sinks,<br/>
And the calm flood<br/>
Already is gilded.<br/>
Warm breathes the rock:<br/>
Did happiness at noonday<br/>
Take its siesta well upon it?<br/>
In green light<br/>
<a id="Page_183" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 183]"></a>Happiness still glimmers up from the brown abyss<br/>
<br/>
Day of my life!<br/>
Eventide's nigh,<br/>
Thy eye already<br/>
Glows half-broken,<br/>
Thy dew already<br/>
Pours out its tear-drops,<br/>
Already over the white seas<br/>
Walks the purple of thy love,<br/>
Thy last hesitating holiness....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
<br/>
Golden gaiety, come!<br/>
Thou, the sweetest foretaste—<br/>
Foretaste of death!<br/>
—Went I my way too swiftly?<br/>
Now that the foot grows weary,<br/>
Thine eye still catches me,<br/>
Thy happiness still catches me.<br/>
<br/>
Around but waves and play.<br/>
Whatever was hard<br/>
—Sank into blue oblivion.<br/>
My boat now stands idle.<br/>
Storm and motion—how did it forget them!<br/>
Desire and Hope are drowned,<br/>
Sea and soul are becalmed.<br/>
<br/>
Seventh Solitude!<br/>
Never felt!<br/>
Sweet certainty nearer,<br/>
Or warmer the sun's ray.<br/>
—Glows not the ice of my summit yet?<br/>
Silvery, light, a fish<br/>
<a id="Page_184" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 184]"></a>Now my vessel swims out....<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So would I die<br/>
As then I saw him die,<br/>
The friend, who like a god<br/>
Into my darkling youth<br/>
Threw lightning's light and fire:<br/>
Buoyant yet deep was he,<br/>
Yea, in the battle's strife<br/>
With the gay dancer's heart.<br/>
<br/>
Amid the warriors<br/>
His was the lightest heart,<br/>
Amid the conquerors<br/>
His brow was dark with thought—<br/>
He was a fate poised on his destiny:<br/>
Unbending, casting thought into the past<br/>
And future, such was he.<br/>
<br/>
Fearful beneath the weight of victory,<br/>
Yet chanting, as both victory and death<br/>
Came hand and hand to him.<br/>
<br/>
Commanding even as he lay in death,<br/>
And his command that man annihilate.<br/>
<br/>
So would I die<br/>
As then I saw him die,<br/>
<a id="Page_185" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 185]"></a>Victorious and destroying.<br/>

<br/>
THE BEACON<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here, where the island grew amid the seas,<br/>
A sacrificial rock high-towering,<br/>
Here under darkling heavens,<br/>
Zarathustra lights his mountain-fires,<br/>
A beacon for ships that have strayed,<br/>
A beacon for them that have an answer!...<br/>
<br/>
These flames with grey-white belly,<br/>
In cold distances sparkle their desire,<br/>
Stretches its neck towards ever purer heights—<br/>
A snake upreared in impatience:<br/>
This signal I set up there before me.<br/>
This flame is mine own soul,<br/>
Insatiable for new distances,<br/>
Speeding upward, upward its silent heat.<br/>
<br/>
Why flew Zarathustra from beasts and men?<br/>
Why fled he swift from all continents?<br/>
Six solitudes he knows already—<br/>
But even the sea was not lonely enough for him,<br/>
On the island he could climb, on the mount he<br/>
<span class="c11">became flame,</span><br/>
At the seventh solitude<br/>
He casts a fishing-rod far o'er his head.<br/>
<br/>
Storm-tossed seamen! Wreckage of ancient stars<br/>
Ye seas of the future! Uncompassed heavens!<br/>
At all lonely ones I now throw my fishing-rod.<br/>
Give answer to the flame's impatience,<br/>
Let me, the fisher on high mountains,<br/>
<a id="Page_186" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 186]"></a>Catch my seventh, last solitude!——<br/>

FAME AND ETERNITY<a id="FNanchor_2_44"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_2_44" class="fnanchor pginternal">[2]</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
Speak, tell me, how long wilt thou brood<br/>
Upon this adverse fate of thine?<br/>
Beware, lest from thy doleful mood<br/>
A countenance <i>90</i> dark is brewed<br/>
That men in seeing thee divine<br/>
A hate more bitter than the brine.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
Speak, why does Zarathustra roam<br/>
Upon the towering mountain-height?<br/>
Distrustful, cankered, dour, his home<br/>
Is shut so long from human sight?<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
See, suddenly flames forth a lightning-flash,<br/>
The pit profound with thunderous challenge fights<br/>
Against the heavens, midst clamorous crack and crash<br/>
Of the great mountain! Cradled in the heights,<br/>
Born as the fruit of hate and lightning's love,<br/>
The wrath of Zarathustra dwells above<br/>
And looms with menace of a thundercloud.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
Ye, who have roofs, go quickly, creep and hide!<br/>
To bed, ye tenderlings! For thunders loud<br/>
Upon the blasts of storm triumphant ride,<br/>
<a id="Page_187" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 187]"></a>And bastions and ramparts sway and rock,<br/>
<br/>
The lightning sears the dusky face of night,<br/>
And eerie truths like gleams of Hades mock<br/>
The sense familiar. So in storm breaks forth<br/>
The flaming curse of Zarathustra's wrath.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2<br/>
<br/>
This fame, which all the wide world loves,<br/>
I touch with gloves,<br/>
And scorning beat<br/>
Beneath my feet.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
Who hanker after the pay of it?<br/>
Who cast themselves in the way of it?<br/>
These prostitutes to gold,<br/>
These merchant folk. They fold<br/>
Their unctuous palms over the jingling fame,<br/>
Whose ringing chink wins all the world's acclaim.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
Hast thou the lust to buy? It needs no skill.<br/>
They are all venal. Let thy purse be deep,<br/>
And let their greedy paws unhindered creep<br/>
Into its depths. So let them take their fill,<br/>
For if thou dost not offer them enough,<br/>
Their "virtue" they'll parade, to hide their huff.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
They are all virtuous, yea every one.<br/>
Virtue and fame are ever in accord<br/>
<a id="Page_188" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 188]"></a>So long as time doth run,<br/>
<br/>
The tongues that prate of virtue as reward<br/>
Earn fame. For virtue is fame's clever bawd.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
Amongst these virtuous, I prefer to be<br/>
One guilty of all vile and horrid sin!<br/>
And when I see fame's importunity<br/>
So advertise her shameless harlotry,<br/>
Ambition turns to gall. Amidst such kin<br/>
One place alone, the lowest, would I win.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
This fame, which all the wide world loves,<br/>
I touch with gloves,<br/>
And scorning beat<br/>
Beneath my feet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3<br/>
<br/>
Hush! I see vastness!—and of vasty things<br/>
Shall man be dumb, unless he can enshrine<br/>
Them with his words? Then take the might which brings<br/>
The heart upon thy tongue, charmed wisdom mine!<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
I look above, there rolls the star-strown sea.<br/>
O night, mute silence, voiceless cry of stars!<br/>
And lo! A sign! The heaven its verge unbars—<br/>
<a id="Page_189" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 189]"></a>A shining constellation falls towards me.<br/>

O loftiest, star-clustered crown of Being!<br/>
O carved tablets of Eternity!<br/>

What? Fear'st not to unveil before <i>my</i> seeing?<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
O shield of Destiny!<br/>
O carven tablets of Eternity!<br/>
Yea, verily, thou knowest—what mankind doth hate,<br/>
What I alone do love: thou art inviolate<br/>
To strokes of change and time, of fates the fate!<br/>
'Tis only thou, O dire Necessity,<br/>
Canst kindle everlasting love in me!<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
O loftiest crown of Life! O shield of Fate!<br/>
That no desire can reach to invocate,<br/>
That ne'er defiled or sullied is by Nay,<br/>
Eternal Yea of life, for e'er am I thy Yea:<br/>
For I love thee, Eternity!<br/></p>

Ye fear me?<br/>
Ye fear the taut-strung bow?<br/>
Ye fear a man might set his arrow to the bow?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
33<br/>
<br/>
I am naught but a word-maker.<br/>
What matter words?<br/>
What matter I?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
34<br/>
<br/>
Ah, my friends,<br/>
Whither has flown all that is called "good"?<br/>
Whither all good people?<br/>
Whither the innocence of all these falsehoods?<br/>
I call all good,<br/>
<a id="Page_196" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 196]"></a>Leaves and grass, happiness, blessing, and rain.<br/>

<br/>
Not through his sins and greatest follies.<br/>
Through his perfection I suffered,<br/>
As I suffered most from men.<a id="FNanchor_1_45"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_1_45" class="fnanchor pginternal">[1]</a><br/>

<br/>
"Man is evil."<br/>
So spake the wisest<br/>
For my consolement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
37<br/>
<br/>
And only when I to myself am a burden<br/>
Do ye fall heavy upon me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
38<br/>
<br/>
Too soon, already<br/>
I laugh again:<br/>
For a foe 'tis easy<br/>
To make me amends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
39<br/>
<br/>
Gentle am I towards man and chance;<br/>
Gentle with all men, and even with grasses:<br/>
A spot of sunshine on winter curtains,<br/>
Moist with tenderness,<br/>
A thawing wind to snow-bound souls:<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
Proud-minded towards trifling<br/>
Gains, where I see the huckster's long finger,<br/>
'Tis aye my pleasure<br/>
To be bamboozled:<br/>
<a id="Page_197" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 197]"></a>Such is the bidding of my fastidious taste.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
40<br/>
<br/>
A strange breath breathes and spits at me,<br/>
Am I a mirror, that straightway is clouded?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
41<br/>
<br/>
Little people,<br/>
Confiding, open-hearted,<br/>
But low-built portals,<br/>
Where only the low of stature can enter.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
How can I get through the city-gate<br/>
Who had forgotten to live among dwarfs?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
42<br/>
<br/>
My wisdom was like to the sun,<br/>
I longed to give them light,<br/>
But I only deceived them.<br/>
The sun of my wisdom<br/>
Blinded the eyes<br/>
Of these poor bats....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
43<br/>
<br/>
Blacker and eviller things didst thou see than ever<br/>
<span class="c11">a seer did:</span><br/>
Through the revels of Hell no sage had ever<br/>
<span class="c11">journeyed.</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
44<br/>
<br/>
Back! on my heels too closely ye follow!<br/>
Back! lest my wisdom should tread on you, crush<br/>
<span class="c12">you!</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
45<br/>
<br/>
"He goes to hell who goes thy ways!"<br/>
So be it I to my hell<br/>
<a id="Page_198" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 198]"></a>I'll pave the way myself with well-made maxims.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
46<br/>
<br/>
Your God, you tell me,<br/>
Is a God of love?<br/>
The sting of conscience<br/>
A sting from God?<br/>
A sting of love?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
48<br/>
<br/>
They chew gravel,<br/>
They lie on their bellies<br/>
Before little round things,<br/>
They adore all that falleth not down—<br/>
These last servants of God<br/>
Believers (in reality)!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
50<br/>
<br/>
They made their God out of nothing,<br/>
What wonder if now he is naught?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
51<br/>
<br/>
Ye loftier men! There have once been<br/>
More thoughtful times, more reflective,<br/>
Than is our to-day and to-morrow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
52<br/>
Our time is like a sick woman—<br/>
Let her but shriek, rave, scold,<br/>
And break the tables and dishes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
54<br/>
<br/>
Ye mount?<br/>
Is it true that ye mount,<br/>
<a id="Page_199" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 199]"></a>Ye loftier men?<br/>
<br/>
Are ye not, pray,<br/>
Like to a ball<br/>
Sped to the heights<br/>
By the lowest that's in you?<br/>
Do ye not flee from yourselves, O ye climbers?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
55<br/>
<br/>
All that you thought<br/>
You had to despise,<br/>
Where you only renounced!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
56<br/>
<br/>
All men repeat the refrain!<br/>
No, no, and thrice say No!<br/>
What's all this yap-yap talk of heaven?<br/>
We would not enter the kingdom of heaven,<br/>
The kingdom of earth shall be ours?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
57<br/>
<br/>
The will redeemeth,<br/>
He that has nothing to do<br/>
In a Nothing finds food for trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
58<br/>
<br/>
You cannot endure it more,<br/>
Your tyrannous destiny,<br/>
Love it—you're given no choice!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
59<br/>
<br/>
These alone free us from woes<br/>
(Choose now I)<br/>
Sudden death<br/>
<a id="Page_200" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 200]"></a>Or long-drawn-out love.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
60<br/>
<br/>
Of death we are sure,<br/>
So why not be merry?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
61<br/>
<br/>
The worst of pleas<br/>
I have hidden from you—that life grew tedious!<br/>
Throw it away, that ye find it again to your taste!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
62<br/>
<br/>
Lonely days,<br/>
Ye must walk on valorous feet!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
63<br/>
<br/>
Loneliness<br/>
Plants naught, it ripens....<br/>
And even then you must have the sun for your<br/>
friend.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
64<br/>
<br/>
Once more must ye plunge in the throng—In<br/>
the throng ye grow hard and smooth.<br/>
Solitude withers<br/>
And lastly destroys.—<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
65<br/>
<br/>
When on the hermit comes the great fear;<br/>
When he runs and runs<br/>
And knows not whither;<br/>
When the storms roar behind<br/>
And the lightning bears witness against him,<br/>
And his cavern breeds spectres<br/>
<a id="Page_201" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 201]"></a>And fills him with dread.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
67<br/>
<br/>
Throw thy pain in the depths,<br/>
Man, forget! Man, forget!<br/>
Divine is the art of forgetting!<br/>
Wouldst fly?<br/>
Wouldst feel at home in the heights?<br/>
Throw thy heaviest load in the sea!<br/>
Here is the sea, hurl thyself in the sea!<br/>
Divine is the art of forgetting!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
69<br/>
<br/>
Look forward, never look back!<br/>
We sink to the depths<br/>
If we peer ever into the depths.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
70<br/>
<br/>
Beware, beware<br/>
Of warning the reckless!<br/>
Thy warning will drive them<br/>
To leap into every abyss!<br/>
<br/>
71<br/>
<br/>
Why hurled he himself from the heights?<br/>
What led him astray?<br/>
His pity for all that is lowly led him astray,<br/>
And now he lies there, broken, useless, and cold.<br/>
<br/>
72<br/>
<br/>
Whither went he? Who knows?<br/>
We only know that he sank.<br/>
A star went out in the desolate void,<br/>
<a id="Page_202" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 202]"></a>And lone was the void.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
73<br/>
<br/>
What we have not<br/>
But need,<br/>
We must take.<br/>
And so a good conscience I took.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
74<br/>
<br/>
Who is there that could bestow right upon thee?<br/>
So take thy right!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
75<br/>
<br/>
O ye waves,<br/>
Wondrous waves, are ye wroth with me?<br/>
Do ye raise me your crests in wrath?<br/>
With my rudder I smite<br/>
Your folly full square.<br/>
This bark ye yourselves<br/>
To immortal life will carry along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
77<br/>
<br/>
When no new voice was heard,<br/>
Ye made from old words<br/>
A law:<br/>
When life grows stark, there shoots up the law.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
78<br/>
<br/>
What none can refute<br/>
Ye say must be true?<br/>
Oh, ye innocents!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
79<br/>
<br/>
Art thou strong?<br/>
Strong as an ass? Strong as God?<br/>
Art thou proud?<br/>
So proud as to flaunt<br/>
<a id="Page_203" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 203]"></a>Unashamed thy conceit?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
80<br/>
<br/>
Beware,<br/>
And ne'er beat the drum<br/>
Of thy destiny I<br/>
Go out of the way<br/>
From all pom-pom of fame!<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
Be not known too soon!<br/>
Be one that has hoarded renown!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
81<br/>
<br/>
Wilt thou grasp at the thorns?<br/>
Thy fingers must pay.<br/>
Grasp at a poniard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
85<br/>
<br/>
Be a tablet of gold,<br/>
They will grave upon thee<br/>
In golden script.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
86<br/>
<br/>
Upright he stands<br/>
With more sense of "justice"<br/>
In his outermost toe<br/>
Than I have in all my head.<br/>
A virtue-monster<br/>
Mantled in white.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
87<br/>
<br/>
Already he mimics himself,<br/>
Already weary he grows,<br/>
Already he seeks the paths he has trod—<br/>
<a id="Page_204" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 204]"></a>Who of late still loved all tracks untrodden!<br/>
<br/>
Secretly burnt—<br/>
Not for his faith,<br/>
Rather because he had lost the heart<br/>
To find new faith.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
88<br/>
<br/>
Too long he sat in the cage,<br/>
That runaway!<br/>
Too long he dreaded<br/>
A gaoler!<br/>
<br/>
Timorous now he goeth his ways,<br/>
All things make him to stumble—<br/>
The shadow e'en of a stick makes him to stumble.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
89<br/>
<br/>
Ye chambers smoky and musty,<br/>
Ye cages and narrow hearts,<br/>
How could your spirit be free?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
90<br/>
<br/>
Narrow souls!<br/>
Huckster-souls!<br/>
When money leaps into the box<br/>
The soul leaps into it too!<a id="FNanchor_2_46"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_2_46" class="fnanchor pginternal">[2]</a><br/>

<br/>
99<br/>
<br/>
They are cold, these men of learning!<br/>
Would that a lightning-flash might strike their food,<br/>
And their mouths could learn to eat fire!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
101<br/>
<br/>
Your false love<br/>
For the past,<br/>
A love for the graves of the dead,<br/>
Is a theft from life<br/>
That steals all the future.<br/>
<span class="c11">*    *    *    *</span><br/>
An antiquary<br/>

Who lives among coffins and skeletons.<br/>

<br/>
Only the poet who can lie<br/>
Wilfully, skilfully,<br/>
Can tell the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
104<br/>
<br/>
Our chase after truth,<br/>
Is't a chase after happiness?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
105<br/>
<br/>
Truth<br/>
Is a woman, no better,<br/>
Cunning in her shame:<br/>
Of what she likes best<br/>
She will know naught,<br/>
And covers her face....<br/>
<a id="Page_206" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 206]"></a>To what doth she yield<br/>
But to violence?<br/>
Violence she needs.<br/>
Be hard, ye sages!<br/>
Ye must compel her,<br/>
That shamefaced Truth....<br/>
For her happiness<br/>
She needs constraint—She<br/>
is a woman, no better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
106<br/>
<br/>
We thought evil of each other?<br/>
We were too distant,<br/>
But now in this tiny hut,<br/>
Pinned to one destiny,<br/>
How could we still be foes?<br/>
We must needs love those<br/>
Whom we cannot escape.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
107<br/>
<br/>
Love thy foe,<br/>
Let the robber rob thee:<br/>
The woman hears and—does it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
110<br/>
<br/>
A proud eye<br/>
With silken curtains,<br/>
Seldom clear,<br/>
Honours him that may see it unveiled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
111<br/>
<br/>
Sluggard eyes<br/>
That seldom love—<br/>
But when they love, the levin flashes<br/>
As from shafts of gold<br/>
<a id="Page_207" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 207]"></a>Where a dagger keeps guard at the treasure of love.<br/>

They are crabs, for whom I have no fellow-feeling.<br/>
Grasp them, they pinch you;<br/>
Leave them alone, and they walk backward.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
119<br/>
<br/>
Crooked go great rivers and men,<br/>
Crooked, but turned to their goal;<br/>
That is their highest courage,<br/>
They dreaded not crooked paths.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
121<br/>
<br/>
Wouldst catch them?<br/>
Then speak to them<br/>
As to stray sheep:<br/>
"Your path, your path<br/>
You have lost!"<br/>
They follow all<br/>
That flatter them so:<br/>
"What? had we a path?"<br/>
Each whispers the other:<br/>
"It really seems that we have a path."<br/></p>

<br/>royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
<br/>of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
<br/>concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,

<br/>specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
<br/>eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
<br/>for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
<br/>performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
<br/>away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
<br/>not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
<br/>trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.
<br/>
<br/>START: FULL LICENSE
<br/>
<br/>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
<br/>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
<br/>
<br/>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
<br/>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
<br/>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<br/>www.gutenberg.org/license.
<br/>
<br/>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works
<br/>
<br/>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
<br/>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
<br/>(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
<br/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
<br/>destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
<br/>possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
<br/>by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
<br/>person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
<br/>1.E.8.
<br/>
<br/>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
<br/>paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
<br/>agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
<br/>
<br/>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
<br/>Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
<br/>of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
<br/>works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
<br/>States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
<br/>United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
<br/>claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
<br/>displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
<br/>all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
<br/>that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
<br/>free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
<br/>comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
<br/>same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
<br/>you share it without charge with others.
<br/>
<br/>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
<br/>what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
<br/>in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
<br/>check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
<br/>agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
<br/>distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
<br/>other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
<br/>representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
<br/>country outside the United States.
<br/>
<br/>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
<br/>
<br/>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
<br/>immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
<br/>prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
<br/>on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
<br/>phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
<br/>performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
<br/>
<br/>  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
<br/>  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
<br/>  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
<br/>  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
<br/>  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
<br/>  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
<br/>  are located before using this ebook.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
<br/>derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
<br/>contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
<br/>copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
<br/>the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
<br/>redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
<br/>either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
<br/>obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
<br/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
<br/>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
<br/>additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
<br/>will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
<br/>posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
<br/>beginning of this work.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

<br/>1.F.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<br/>works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
<br/>contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
<br/>or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
<br/>intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
<br/>other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
<br/>cannot be read by your equipment.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
<br/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
<br/>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
<br/>fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
<br/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
<br/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
<br/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
<br/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
<br/>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br/>DAMAGE.

<br/>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
<br/>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
<br/>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
<br/>written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
<br/>with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
<br/>with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
<br/>lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
<br/>or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
<br/>opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
<br/>the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
<br/>without further opportunities to fix the problem.
<br/>

<br/>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
<br/>damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
<br/>violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
<br/>agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
<br/>limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
<br/>unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
<br/>remaining provisions.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
<br/>accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
<br/>production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
<br/>including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
<br/>the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
<br/>or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
<br/>additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
<br/>Defect you cause.
<br/>
<br/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
<br/>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
<br/>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
<br/>from people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
<br/>generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
<br/>Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
<br/>www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
<br/>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
<br/>state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
<br/>donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
<br/>
<br/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
<br/>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
<br/>distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
<br/>volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
<br/>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
<br/>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
<br/>edition.
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
<br/>facility: www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
