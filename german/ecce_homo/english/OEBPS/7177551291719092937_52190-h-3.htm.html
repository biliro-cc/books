<p class="parnum">1</p>
<p>I now wish to relate the history of <i>Zarathustra.</i> The fundamental idea of the work, the <i>Eternal Recurrence,</i> the highest formula of a Yea-saying to life that can ever be attained, was first conceived in the month of August 1881. I made a note of the idea on a sheet of paper, with the postscript: "Six thousand feet beyond man and time." That day I happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of the Lake of Silvaplana, and I halted not far from Surlei, beside a huge rock that towered aloft like a pyramid. It was then that<a id="Page_97" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 97]"></a> the thought struck me. Looking back now, I find that exactly two months before this inspiration I had an omen of its coming in the form of a sudden and decisive change in my tastes—more particularly in music. The whole of <i>Zarathustra</i> might perhaps be classified under the rubric music. At all events, the essential condition of its production was a second birth within me of the art of hearing. In Recoaro, a small mountain resort near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of 1881, I and my friend and maestro, Peter Gast—who was also one who had been born again, discovered that the phœnix music hovered over us, in lighter and brighter plumage than it had ever worn before. If, therefore, I now calculate from that day forward the sudden production of the book, under the most unlikely circumstances, in February 1883,—the last part, out of which I quoted a few lines in my preface, was written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost in Venice,—I come to the conclusion that the period of gestation covered eighteen months. This period of exactly eighteen months, might suggest, at least to Buddhists, that I am in reality a female elephant The interval was devoted to the <i>Gaya Scienza,</i> which contains hundreds of indications of the proximity of something unparalleled; for, after all, it shows the beginning of <i>Zarathustra,</i> since it presents <i>Zarathustra's</i> fundamental thought in the last aphorism but one of the fourth book. To this interval also belongs that <i>Hymn to Life</i> (for a mixed choir and orchestra), the score of which was published in<a id="Page_98" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 98]"></a> Leipzig two years ago by E. W. Fritsch, and which gave perhaps no slight indication of my spiritual state during this year, in which the essentially yea-saying pathos, which I call the tragic pathos, completely filled me heart and limb. One day people will sing it to my memory. The text, let it be well understood, as there is some misunderstanding abroad on this point, is not by me; it was the astounding inspiration of a young Russian lady, Miss Lou von Salome, with whom I was then on friendly terms. He who is in any way able to make some sense of the last words of the poem, will divine why I preferred and admired it: there is greatness in them. Pain is not regarded as an objection to existence: "And if thou hast no bliss now left to crown me—Lead on! Thou hast thy Sorrow still."</p>
<p>Maybe that my music is also great in this passage. (The last note of the oboe, by the bye, is C sharp, not C. The latter is a misprint.) During the following winter, I was living on that charmingly peaceful Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, which cuts inland between Chiavari and Cape Porto Fino. My health was not very good; the winter was cold and exceptionally rainy; and the small <i>albergo</i> in which I lived was so close to the water that at night my sleep was disturbed if the sea was rough. These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable; and yet, in spite of it all, and as if in proof of my belief that everything decisive comes to life in defiance of every obstacle, it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable<a id="Page_99" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 99]"></a> circumstances that my <i>Zarathustra</i> originated. In the morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which rises up through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out to sea. In the afternoon, or as often as my health allowed, I walked round the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino. This spot affected me all the more deeply because it was so dearly loved by the Emperor Frederick III. In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this small forgotten world of happiness for the last time. It was on these two roads that all <i>Zarathustra</i> came to me, above all, Zarathustra himself as a type—I ought rather to say that it was on these walks that <i>he waylaid me</i>.</p>
<p class="parnum">2</p>
<p>In order to understand this type, you must first be quite clear concerning its fundamental physiological condition: this condition is what I call <i>great healthiness.</i> In regard to this idea I cannot make my meaning more plain or more personal than I have done already in one of the last aphorisms (No. 382) of the fifth book of the <i>Gaya Scienza</i>: "We new, nameless, and unfathomable creatures," so reads the passage, "we firstlings of a future still unproved—we who have a new end in view also require new means to that end, that is to say, a new healthiness, a stronger, keener, tougher, bolder, and merrier healthiness than any that has existed heretofore. He who longs to<a id="Page_100" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 100]"></a> feel in his own soul the whole range of values and aims that have prevailed on earth until his day, and to sail round all the coasts of this ideal 'Mediterranean Sea'; who, from the adventures of his own inmost experience, would fain know how it feels to be a conqueror and discoverer of the ideal;—as also how it is with the artist, the saint, the legislator, the sage, the scholar, the man of piety and the godlike anchorite of yore;—such a man requires one thing above all for his purpose, and that is, <i>great healthiness</i>—such healthiness as he not only possesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because he is continually sacrificing it again, and is compelled to sacrifice it! And now, therefore, after having been long on the way, we Argonauts of the ideal, whose pluck is greater than prudence would allow, and who are often shipwrecked and bruised, but, as I have said, healthier than people would like to admit, dangerously healthy, and for ever recovering our health—it would seem as if we had before us, as a reward for all our toils, a country still undiscovered, the horizon of which no one has yet seen, a beyond to every country and every refuge of the ideal that man has ever known, a world so overflowing with beauty, strangeness, doubt, terror, and divinity, that both our curiosity and our lust of possession are frantic with eagerness. Alas! how in the face of such vistas, and with such burning desire in our conscience and consciousness, could we still be content with <i>the man of the present day</i>? This is bad indeed; but, that we should regard his worthiest aims and hopes with ill-concealed amusement,<a id="Page_101" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 101]"></a> or perhaps give them no thought at all, is inevitable. Another ideal now leads us on, a wonderful, seductive ideal, full of danger, the pursuit of which we should be loath to urge upon any one, because we are not so ready to acknowledge any one's <i>right to it:</i> the ideal of a spirit who plays ingenuously (that is to say, involuntarily, and as the outcome of superabundant energy and power) with everything that, hitherto, has been called holy, good, inviolable, and divine; to whom even the loftiest thing that the people have with reason made their measure of value would be no better than a danger, a decay, and an abasement, or at least a relaxation and temporary forgetfulness of self: the ideal of a humanly superhuman well-being and goodwill, which often enough will seem inhuman—as when, for instance, it stands beside all past earnestness on earth, and all past solemnities in hearing, speech, tone, look, morality, and duty, as their most lifelike and unconscious parody—but with which, nevertheless, <i>great earnestness</i> perhaps alone begins, the first note of interrogation is affixed, the fate of the soul changes, the hour hand moves, and tragedy begins."</p>
<p class="parnum">3</p>
<p>Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration? If not, I will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige of superstition left in one, it would hardly be possible completely to set aside the idea that one is the mere<a id="Page_102" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 102]"></a> incarnation, mouthpiece, or medium of an almighty power. The idea of revelation, in the sense that something which profoundly convulses and upsets one becomes suddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy—describes the simple fact. One hears—one does not seek; one takes—one does not ask who gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, without faltering—I have never had any choice in the matter. There is an ecstasy so great that the immense strain of it is sometimes relaxed by a flood of tears, during which one's steps now involuntarily rush and anon involuntarily lag. There is the feeling that one is utterly out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an endless number of fine thrills and titillations descending to one's very toes;—there is a depth of happiness in which the most painful and gloomy parts do not act as antitheses to the rest, but are produced and required as necessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light. There is an instinct for rhythmic relations which embraces a whole world of forms (length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and tension). Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity. The involuntary nature of the figures and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all perception of what is imagery and metaphor; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the truest, and simplest means of expression. It actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra's<a id="Page_103" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 103]"></a> own phrases, as if all things came to one, and offered themselves as similes. ("Here do all things come caressingly to thy discourse and flatter thee, for they would fain ride upon thy back. On every simile thou ridest here unto every truth. Here fly open unto thee all the speech and word shrines of the world, here would all existence become speech, here would all Becoming learn of thee how to speak.") This is my experience of inspiration. I do not doubt but that I should have to go back thousands of years before I could find another who could say to me: "It is mine also!"</p>
<p class="parnum">4</p>
<p>For a few weeks afterwards I lay an invalid in Genoa. Then followed a melancholy spring in Rome, where I only just managed to live—and this was no easy matter. This city, which is absolutely unsuited to the poet-author of <i>Zarathustra,</i> and for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me inordinately miserable. I tried to leave it. I wanted to go to Aquila—the opposite of Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of hostility towards that city, just as I also shall found a city some day, as a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church, a person very closely related to me, the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick II. But Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome. In the end I was obliged to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after I had exerted myself in vain to find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear that on one occasion, to avoid bad<a id="Page_104" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 104]"></a> smells as much as possible, I actually inquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a quiet room for a philosopher. In a chamber high above the Piazza just mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome, and could hear the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs was composed—"The Night-Song." About this time I was obsessed by an unspeakably sad melody, the refrain of which I recognised in the affords, "dead through immortality," ... In the summer, finding myself once more in the sacred place where the first thought of <i>Zarathustra</i> flashed like a light across my mind, I conceived the second part. Ten days sufficed. Neither for the second, the first, nor the third part, have I required a day longer. In the ensuing winter, beneath the halcyon sky of Nice, which then for the first time poured its light into my life, I found the third <i>Zarathustra</i>—and came to the end of my task: the whole having occupied me scarcely a year. Many hidden corners and heights in the country round about Nice are hallowed for me by moments that I can never forget. That decisive chapter, entitled "Old and New Tables," was composed during the arduous ascent from the station to Eza—that wonderful Moorish village in the rocks. During those moments when my creative energy flowed most plentifully, my muscular activity was always greatest. The body is inspired: let us waive the question of "soul." I might often have been seen dancing in those days, and I could then walk for seven or eight hours on end over the hills without a suggestion of fatigue. I slept well and<a id="Page_105" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 105]"></a> laughed a good deal—I was perfectly robust and patient.</p>
<p class="parnum">5</p>
<p>With the exception of these periods of industry lasting ten days, the years I spent during the production of <i>Zarathustra,</i> and thereafter, were for me years of unparalleled distress. A man pays dearly for being immortal: to this end he must die many times over during his life. There is such a thing as what I call the rancour of greatness: everything great, whether a work or a deed, once it is completed, turns immediately against its author. The very fact that he is its author makes him weak at this time. He can no longer endure his deed. He can no longer look it full in the face. To have something at one's back which one could never have willed, something to which the knot of human destiny is attached—and to be forced thenceforward to bear it on one's shoulders! Why, it almost crushes one! The rancour of greatness! A somewhat different experience is the uncanny silence that reigns about one. Solitude has seven skins which nothing can penetrate. One goes among men; one greets friends: but these things are only new deserts, the looks of those one meets no longer bear a greeting. At the best one encounters a sort of revolt. This feeling of revolt, I suffered, in varying degrees of intensity, at the hands of almost every one who came near me; it would seem that nothing inflicts a deeper wound than suddenly to make one's distance felt. Those noble natures are scarce who<a id="Page_106" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 106]"></a> know not how to live unless they can revere. A third thing is the absurd susceptibility of the skin to small pin-pricks, a kind of helplessness in the presence of all small things. This seems to me a necessary outcome of the appalling expenditure of all defensive forces, which is the first condition of every <i>creative</i> act, of every act which proceeds from the most intimate, most secret, and most concealed recesses of a man's being. The small defensive forces are thus, as it were, suspended, and no fresh energy reaches them. I even think it probable that one does not digest so well, that one is less willing to move, and that one is much too open to sensations of coldness and suspicion; for, in a large number of cases, suspicion is merely a blunder in etiology. On one occasion when I felt like this I became conscious of the proximity of a herd of cows, some time before I could possibly have seen it with my eyes, simply owing to a return in me of milder and more humane sentiments: <i>they</i> communicated warmth to me....</p>
<p class="parnum">6</p>
<p>This work stands alone. Do not let us mention the poets in the same breath; nothing perhaps has ever been produced out of such a superabundance of strength. My concept "Dionysian" here became the <i>highest</i> deed; compared with it everything that other men have done seems poor and limited. The fact that a Goethe or a Shakespeare would not for an instant have known how to take breath in this atmosphere of passion and of the heights; the<a id="Page_107" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 107]"></a> fact that by the side of Zarathustra, Dante is no more than a believer, and not one who first <i>creates</i> the truth—that is to say, not a world-ruling spirit, a <i>Fate</i>; the fact that the poets of the Veda were priests and not even fit to unfasten Zarathustra's sandal—all this is the least of things, and gives no idea of the distance, of the azure solitude, in which this work dwells. Zarathustra has an eternal right to say: "I draw around me circles and holy boundaries. Ever fewer are they that mount with me to ever loftier heights. I build me a mountain range of ever holier mountains." If all the spirit and goodness of every great soul were collected together, the whole could not create a single one of Zarathustra's discourses. The ladder upon which he rises and descends is of boundless length; he has seen further, he has willed further, and <i>gone</i> further than any other man. There is contradiction in every word that he utters, this most yea-saying of all spirits. Through him all contradictions are bound up into a new unity. The loftiest and the basest powers of human nature, the sweetest, the lightest, and the most terrible, rush forth from out one spring with everlasting certainty. Until his coming no one knew what was height, or depth, and still less what was truth. There is not a single passage in this revelation of truth which had already been anticipated and divined by even the greatest among men. Before Zarathustra there was no wisdom, no probing of the soul, no art of speech: in his book, the most familiar and most vulgar thing utters unheard-of words. The sentence quivers with passion. Eloquence has become music. Forks of<a id="Page_108" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 108]"></a> lightning are hurled towards futures of which no one has ever dreamed before. The most powerful use of parables that has yet existed is poor beside it, and mere child's-play compared with this return of language to the nature of imagery. See how Zarathustra goes down from the mountain and speaks the kindest words to every one! See with what delicate fingers he touches his very adversaries, the priests, and how he suffers with them from themselves! Here, at every moment, man is overcome, and the concept "Superman" becomes the greatest reality,—out of sight, almost far away beneath him, lies all that which heretofore has been called great in man. The halcyonic brightness, the light feet, the presence of wickedness and exuberance throughout, and all that is the essence of the type Zarathustra, was never dreamt of before as a prerequisite of greatness. In precisely these limits of space and in this accessibility to opposites Zarathustra feels himself the <i>highest of all living things</i>: and when you hear how he defines this highest, you will give up trying to find his equal.</p>
<p>"The soul which hath the longest ladder and can step down deepest,</p>
<p>"The vastest soul that can run and stray and rove furthest in its own domain,</p>
<p>"The most necessary soul, that out of desire flingeth itself to chance,</p>
<p>"The stable soul that plungeth into Becoming, the possessing soul that must needs taste of willing and longing,</p>
<p>"The soul that flyeth from itself, and over-taketh itself in the widest circle,</p>
<p><a id="Page_109" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 109]"></a></p>
<p>"The wisest soul that folly exhorteth most sweetly,</p>
<p>"The most self-loving soul, in whom all things have their rise, their ebb and flow."</p>
<p>But this is the very idea of Dionysus. Another consideration leads to this idea. The psychological problem presented by the type of Zarathustra is, how can he, who in an unprecedented manner says no, and <i>acts</i> no, in regard to all that which has been affirmed hitherto, remain nevertheless a yea-saying spirit? how can he who bears the heaviest destiny on his shoulders and whose very life-task is a fatality, yet be the brightest and the most transcendental of spirits—for Zarathustra is a dancer? how can he who has the hardest and most terrible grasp of reality, and who has thought the most "abysmal thoughts," nevertheless avoid conceiving these things as objections to existence, or even as objections to the eternal recurrence of existence?—how is it that on the contrary he finds reasons for <i>being himself</i> the eternal affirmation of all things, "the tremendous and unlimited saying of Yea and Amen"?... "Into every abyss do I bear the benediction of my yea to Life." ... But this, once more, is precisely the idea of Dionysus.</p>
<p class="parnum">7</p>
<p>What language will such a spirit speak, when he speaks unto his soul? The language of the <i>dithyramb.</i> I am the inventor of the dithyramb. Hearken unto the manner in which Zarathustra speaks to his soul <i>Before Sunrise</i> (iii. 48). Before<a id="Page_110" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 110]"></a> my time such emerald joys and divine tenderness had found no tongue. Even the profoundest melancholy of such a Dionysus takes shape as a dithyramb. As an example of this I take "The Night-Song,"—the immortal plaint of one who, thanks to his superabundance of light and power, thanks to the sun within him, is condemned never to love.</p>
<p>"It is night: now do all gushing springs raise their voices. And my soul too is a gushing spring.</p>
<p>"It is night: now only do all lovers burst into song. And my soul too is the song of a lover.</p>
<p>"Something unquenched and unquenchable is within me, that would raise its voice. A craving for love is within me, which itself speaketh the language of love.</p>
<p>"Light am I: would that I were night! But this is my loneliness, that I am begirt with light.</p>
<p>"Alas, why am I not dark and like unto the night! How joyfully would I then suck at the breasts of light!</p>
<p>"And even you would I bless, ye twinkling starlets and glow-worms on high! and be blessed in the gifts of your light.</p>
<p>"But in mine own light do I live, ever back into myself do I drink the flames I send forth.</p>
<p>"I know not the happiness of the hand stretched forth to grasp; and oft have I dreamt that stealing must be more blessed than taking.</p>
<p>"Wretched am I that my hand may never rest from giving: an envious fate is mine that I see expectant eyes and nights made bright with longing.</p>
<p><a id="Page_111" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 111]"></a></p>
<p>"Oh, the wretchedness of all them that give! Oh, the clouds that cover the face of my sun! That craving for desire! that burning hunger at the end of the feast!</p>
<p>"They take what I give them; but do I touch their soul? A gulf is there 'twixt giving and taking; and the smallest gulf is the last to be bridged.</p>
<p>"An appetite is born from out my beauty: would that I might do harm to them that I fill with light; would that I might rob them of the gifts I have given:—thus do I thirst for wickedness.</p>
<p>"To withdraw my hand when their hand is ready stretched forth like the waterfall that wavers, wavers even in its fall:—thus do I thirst for wickedness.</p>
<p>"For such vengeance doth my fulness yearn: to such tricks doth my loneliness give birth.</p>
<p>"My joy in giving died with the deed. By its very fulness did my virtue grow weary of itself.</p>
<p>"He who giveth risketh to lose his shame; he that is ever distributing groweth callous in hand and heart therefrom.</p>
<p>"Mine eyes no longer melt into tears at the sight of the suppliant's shame; my hand hath become too hard to feel the quivering of laden hands.</p>
<p>"Whither have ye fled, the tears of mine eyes and the bloom of my heart? Oh, the solitude of all givers! Oh, the silence of all beacons!</p>
<p>"Many are the suns that circle in barren space; to all that is dark do they speak with their light—to me alone are they silent.</p>
<p>"Alas, this is the hatred of light for that which shineth: pitiless it runneth its course.</p>
<p><a id="Page_112" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 112]"></a></p>
<p>"Unfair in its inmost heart to that which shineth; cold toward suns,—thus doth every sun go its way.</p>
<p>"Like a tempest do the suns fly over their course: for such is their way. Their own unswerving will do they follow: that is their coldness.</p>
<p>"Alas, it is ye alone, ye creatures of gloom, ye spirits of the night, that take your warmth from that which shineth. Ye alone suck your milk and comfort from the udders of light.</p>
<p>"Alas, about me there is ice, my hand burneth itself against ice!</p>
<p>"Alas, within me is a thirst that thirsteth for your thirst!</p>
<p>"It is night: woe is me, that I must needs be light! And thirst after darkness! And loneliness!</p>
<p>"It is night: now doth my longing burst forth like a spring,—for speech do I long.</p>
<p>"It is night: now do all gushing springs raise their voices. And my soul too is a gushing spring.</p>
<p>"It is night: now only do all lovers burst into song. And my soul too is the song of a lover."</p>
<p class="parnum">8</p>
<p>Such things have never been written, never been felt, never been <i>suffered:</i> only a God, only Dionysus suffers in this way. The reply to such a dithyramb on the sun's solitude in light would be Ariadne. ... Who knows, but I, who Ariadne is! To all such riddles no one heretofore had ever found an answer; I doubt even whether any one had ever seen a riddle here. One day Zarathustra severely<a id="Page_113" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 113]"></a> determines his life-task—and it is also mine. Let no one misunderstand its meaning. It's a yea-saying to the point of justifying, to the point of redeeming even all that is past.</p>
<p>"I walk among men as among fragments of the future: of that future which I see.</p>
<p>"And all my creativeness and effort is but this, that I may be able to think and recast all these fragments and riddles and dismal accidents into one piece.</p>
<p>"And how could I bear to be a man, if man were not also a poet, a riddle reader, and a redeemer of chance!</p>
<p>"To redeem all the past, and to transform every 'it was' into 'thus would I have it'—that alone would be my salvation!"</p>
<p>In another passage he defines as strictly as possible what to him alone "man" can be,—not a subject for love nor yet for pity—Zarathustra became master even of his loathing of man: man is to him a thing unshaped, raw material, an ugly stone that needs the sculptor's chisel.</p>
<p>"No longer to will, no longer to value, no longer to create! Oh, that this great weariness may never be mine!</p>
<p>"Even in the lust of knowledge, I feel only the joy of my will to beget and to grow; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is because my procreative will is in it.</p>
<p>"Away from God and gods did this will lure me: what would there be to create if there were gods?</p>
<p>"But to man doth it ever drive me anew, my<a id="Page_114" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 114]"></a> burning, creative will. Thus driveth it the hammer to the stone.</p>
<p>"Alas, ye men, within the stone there sleepeth an image for me, the image of all my dreams! Alas, that it should have to sleep in the hardest and ugliest stone!</p>
<p>"<i>Now rageth my hammer ruthlessly against its prison.</i> From the stone the fragments fly: what's that to me?</p>
<p>"I will finish it: for a shadow came unto me—the stillest and lightest thing on earth once came unto me!</p>
<p>"The beauty of the Superman came unto me as a shadow. Alas, my brethren! What are the—gods to me now?"</p>
<p>Let me call attention to one last point of view. The line in italics is my pretext for this remark. A Dionysian life-task needs the hardness of the hammer, and one of its first essentials is without doubt the <i>joy even of destruction.</i> The command, "Harden yourselves!" and the deep conviction that <i>all creators are hard,</i> is the really distinctive sign of a Dionysian nature.</p>

<h5>"THE PRELUDE TO A PHILOSOPHY OF THE FUTURE"</h5>
<p class="parnum">1</p>
<p>My work for the years that followed was prescribed as distinctly as possible. Now that the yea-saying part of my life-task was accomplished,<a id="Page_115" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 115]"></a> there came the turn of the negative portion, both in word and deed: the transvaluation of all values that had existed hitherto, the great war,—the conjuring-up of the day when the fatal outcome of the struggle would be decided. Meanwhile, I had slowly to look about me for my peers, for those who, <i>out of strength,</i> would proffer me a helping hand in my work of destruction. From that time onward, all my writings are so much bait: maybe I understand as much about fishing as most people? If nothing was <i>caught,</i> it was not I who was at fault <i>There were no fish to come and bite.</i></p>

<p>In all its essential points, this book (1886) is a criticism of <i>modernity,</i> embracing the modern sciences, arts, even politics, together with certain indications as to a type which would be the reverse of modern man, or as little like him as possible, a noble and yea-saying type. In this last respect the book is a <i>school for gentlemen</i>—the term <i>gentleman</i> being understood here in a much more spiritual and radical sense than it has implied hitherto. All those things of which the age is proud,—as, for instance, far-famed "objectivity," "sympathy with all that suffers," "the historical sense," with its subjection to foreign tastes, with its lying-in-the-dust before <i>petits faits,</i> and the rage for science,—are shown to be the contradiction of the type recommended, and are regarded as almost ill-bred. If you remember that this book follows upon <i>Zarathustra,</i> you may possibly guess to what system of diet it owes its life. The eye which,<a id="Page_116" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 116]"></a> owing to tremendous constraint, has become accustomed to see at a great distance,—<i>Zarathustra</i> is even more far-sighted than the Tsar,—is here forced to focus sharply that which is close at hand, the present time, the things that lie about him. In all the aphorisms and more particularly in the form of this book, the reader will find the same <i>voluntary</i> turning away from those instincts which made a <i>Zarathustra</i> a possible feat. Refinement in form, in aspiration, and in the art of keeping silent, are its more or less obvious qualities; psychology is handled with deliberate hardness and cruelty,—the whole book does not contain one single good-natured word.... All this sort of thing refreshes a man. Who can guess the kind of recreation that is necessary after such an expenditure of goodness as is to be found in <i>Zarathustra</i>? From a theological standpoint—now pay ye heed; for it is but on rare occasions that I speak as a theologian—it was God Himself who, at the end of His great work, coiled Himself up in the form of a serpent at the foot of the tree of knowledge. It was thus that He recovered from being a God.... He had made everything too beautiful.... The devil is simply God's moment of idleness, on that seventh day.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00020"><a id="THE_GENEALOGY_OF_MORALS_A_POLEMIC">"THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS: A POLEMIC"</a></h4>
<p>The three essays which constitute this genealogy are, as regards expression, aspiration, and the art<a id="Page_117" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 117]"></a> of the unexpected, perhaps the most curious things that have ever been written. Dionysus, as you know, is also the god of darkness. In each case the beginning is calculated to mystify; it is cool, scientific, even ironical, intentionally thrust to the fore, intentionally reticent. Gradually less calmness prevails; here and there a flash of lightning defines the horizon; exceedingly unpleasant truths break upon your ears from out remote distances with a dull, rumbling sound,—until very soon a fierce tempo is attained in which everything presses forward at a terrible degree of tension. At the end, in each case, amid fearful thunderclaps, a new truth shines out between thick clouds. The truth of the first essays the psychology of Christianity: the birth of Christianity out of the spirit of resentment, not, as is supposed, out of the "Spirit,"—in all its essentials, a counter-movement, the great insurrection against the dominion of noble values. The second essay contains the psychology of conscience: this is not, as you may believe, "the voice of God in man"; it is the instinct of cruelty, which turns inwards once it is unable to discharge itself outwardly. Cruelty is here exposed, for the first time, as one of the oldest and most indispensable elements in the foundation of culture. The third essay replies to the question as to the origin of the formidable power of the ascetic ideal, of the priest ideal, despite the fact that this ideal is essentially detrimental, that it is a will to nonentity and to decadence. Reply: it flourished not because God was active behind the priests, as is generally believed, but because it was<a id="Page_118" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 118]"></a> a <i>faute de mieux</i>—from the fact that hitherto it has been the only ideal and has had no competitors. "For man prefers to aspire to nonentity than not to aspire at all." But above all, until the time of <i>Zarathustra</i> there was no such thing as a counter-ideal. You have understood my meaning. Three decisive overtures on the part of a psychologist to a <i>Transvaluation of all Values.</i>—This book contains the first psychology of the priest.</p>

<h5>HOW TO PHILOSOPHISE WITH THE HAMMER"</h5>
<p class="parnum">1</p>
<p>This work—which covers scarcely one hundred and fifty pages, with its cheerful and fateful tone, like a laughing demon, and the production of which occupied so few days that I hesitate to give their number—is altogether an exception among books: there is no work more rich in substance, more independent, more upsetting—more wicked. If any one should desire to obtain a rapid sketch of how everything, before my time, was standing on its head, he should begin reading me in this book. That which is called "Idols" on the title page is simply the old truth that has been believed in hitherto. In plain English, <i>The Twilight of the Idols</i> means that the old truth is on its last legs.</p>
<p><a id="Page_119" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 119]"></a></p>

<p>There is no reality, no "ideality," which has not been touched in this book (touched! what a cautious euphemism!). Not only the eternal idols, but also the youngest—that is to say, the most senile: modern ideas, for instance. A strong wind blows between the trees and in all directions fall the fruit—the truths. There is the waste of an all-too-rich autumn in this book: you trip over truths. You even crush some to death, there are too many of them. Those things that you can grasp, however, are quite unquestionable; they are irrevocable decrees. I alone have the criterion of "truths" in my possession. I alone <i>can</i> decide. It would seem as if a second consciousness had grown up in me, as if the "life-will" in me had thrown a light upon the downward path along which it has been running throughout the ages. The <i>downward path</i>—hitherto this had been called the road to "Truth." All obscure impulse—"darkness and dismay"—is at an end, the "<i>good man</i>" was precisely he who was least aware of the proper way.<a id="FNanchor_1_19"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor pginternal">[1]</a> And, speaking in all earnestness, no one before me knew the proper way, the way upwards: only after my time could men once more find hope, life-tasks, and roads mapped out<a id="Page_120" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 120]"></a> that lead to culture—<i>I am the joyful harbinger of this culture.</i> ... On this account alone I am also a fatality.</p>
<p class="parnum">3</p>
<p>Immediately after the completion of the above-named work, and without letting even one day go by, I tackled the formidable task of the <i>Transvaluation</i> with a supreme feeling of pride which nothing could equal; and, certain at each moment of my immortality, I cut sign after sign upon tablets of brass with the sureness of Fate. The Preface came into being on 3rd September 1888. When, after having written it down, I went out into the open that morning, I was greeted by the most beautiful day I had ever seen in the Upper Engadine—clear, glowing with colour, and presenting all the contrasts and all the intermediary gradations between ice and the south. I left Sils-Maria only on the 20th of September. I had been forced to delay my departure owing to floods, and I was very soon, and for some days, the only visitor in this wonderful spot, on which my gratitude bestows the gift of an immortal name. After a journey that was full of incidents, and not without danger to life,—as for instance at Como, which was flooded when I reached it in the dead of night,—I got to Turin on the afternoon of the 21 st. Turin is the only suitable place for me, and it shall be my home henceforward. I took the same lodgings as I had occupied in the spring, 6111 Via Carlo Alberto, opposite the mighty Palazzo Carignano, in which Vittorio Emanuele was born; and I had a view of the Piazza Carlo Alberto and<a id="Page_121" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 121]"></a> above it across to the hills. Without hesitating, or allowing myself to be disturbed for a single moment, I returned to my work, only the last quarter of which had still to be written. On the 30th September, tremendous triumph; the seventh day; the leisure of a god on the banks of the Po.<a id="FNanchor_2_20"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_2_20" class="fnanchor pginternal">[2]</a> On the same day, I wrote the Preface to <i>The Twilight of the Idols,</i> the correction of the proofs of which provided me with recreation during the month of September. Never in my life have I experienced such an autumn; nor had I ever imagined that such things were possible on earth—a Claude Lorrain extended to infinity, each day equal to the last in its wild perfection.</p>

<p class="parnum">1</p>
<p>In order to do justice to this essay a man ought to suffer from the fate of music as from an open wound.—From what do I suffer when I suffer from the fate of music? From the fact that music has lost its world-transfiguring, yea-saying character—that it is decadent music and no longer the flute of Dionysus. Supposing, however, that the fate of music be as dear to man as his own life, because joy and suffering are alike bound up with it; then he will find this pamphlet comparatively mild and<a id="Page_122" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 122]"></a> full of consideration. To be cheerful in such circumstances, and laugh good-naturedly with others at one's self,—<i>ridendodicere severum</i><a id="FNanchor_1_21"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor pginternal">[1]</a> when the <i>verum dicere</i> would justify every sort of hardness,—is humanity itself. Who doubts that I, old artillery-man that I am, would be able if I liked to point my <i>heavy</i> guns at Wagner?—Everything decisive in this question I kept to myself—I have loved Wagner.—After all, an attack upon a more than usually subtle "unknown person" whom another would not have divined so easily, lies in the meaning and path of my life-task. Oh, I have still quite a number of other "unknown persons" to unmask besides a Cagliostro of Music! Above all, I have to direct an attack against the German people, who, in matters of the spirit, grow every day more indolent, poorer in instincts, and more <i>honest</i> who, with an appetite for which they are to be envied, continue to diet themselves on contradictions, and gulp down "Faith" in company with science, Christian love together with anti-Semitism, and the will to power (to the "Empire"), dished up with the gospel of the humble, without showing the slightest signs of indigestion. Fancy this absence of party-feeling in the presence of opposites! Fancy this gastric neutrality and "disinterestedness"! Behold this sense of justice in the German palate, which can grant equal rights to all,—which finds everything tasteful! Without a shadow of a doubt the Germans are idealists. When I was last in Germany, I found German taste striving to grant<a id="Page_123" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 123]"></a> Wagner and the <i>Trumpeter of Sakkingen</i><a id="FNanchor_2_22"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor pginternal">[2]</a> equal rights; while I myself witnessed the attempts of the people of Leipzig to do honour to one of the most genuine and most German of musicians,—using German here in the old sense of the word,—a man who was no mere German of the Empire, the master Heinrich Schütz, by founding a Liszt Society, the object of which was to cultivate and spread artful (<i>listige</i><a id="FNanchor_3_23"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_3_23" class="fnanchor pginternal">[3]</a>) Church music. Without a shadow of doubt the Germans are idealists.</p>
<p class="parnum">2</p>
<p>But here nothing shall stop me from being rude, and from telling the Germans one or two unpleasant home truths: who else would do it if I did not? I refer to their laxity in matters historical. Not only have the Germans entirely lost the <i>breadth of vision</i> which enables one to grasp the course of culture and the values of culture; not only are they one and all political (or Church) puppets; but they have also actually <i>put a ban upon</i> this very breadth of vision. A man must first and foremost be "German," he must belong to "<i>the</i> race"; then only can he pass judgment upon all values and lack of values in history—then only can he establish them.... To be German is in itself an argument, "Germany, Germany above all,"<a id="FNanchor_4_24"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_4_24" class="fnanchor pginternal">[4]</a> is a principle; the Germans<a id="Page_124" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 124]"></a> stand for the "moral order of the universe" in history; compared with the Roman Empire, they are the up-holders of freedom; compared with the eighteenth century, they are the restorers of morality, of the "Categorical Imperative." There is such a thing as the writing of history according to the lights of Imperial Germany; there is, I fear, anti-Semitic history—there is also history written with an eye to the Court, and Herr von Treitschke is not ashamed of himself. Quite recently an idiotic opinion <i>in historicis,</i> an observation of Vischer the Swabian æsthete, since happily deceased, made the round of the German newspapers as a "truth" to which every German <i>must assent</i> The observation was this: "The Renaissance <i>and</i> the Reformation only together constitute a whole—the æsthetic rebirth, and the moral rebirth." When I listen to such things, I lose all patience, and I feel inclined, I even feel it my duty, to tell the Germans, for once in a way, all that they have on their conscience. <i>Every great crime against culture for the last four centuries lies on their conscience....</i> And always for the same reason, always owing to their bottomless cowardice in the face of reality, which is also cowardice in the face of truth; always owing to the love of falsehood which has become almost instinctive in them—in short, "idealism." It was the Germans who caused Europe to lose the fruits, the whole meaning of her last period of greatness—the period of the Renaissance. At a moment when a higher order of values, values that were noble, that said yea to life, and that guaranteed a future, had succeeded in triumphing over the opposite values,<a id="Page_125" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 125]"></a> the values of degeneration, in the very seat of Christianity itself,—and <i>even in the hearts of those sitting there,</i>—Luther, that cursed monk, not only restored the Church, but, what was a thousand times worse, restored Christianity, and at a time too when it lay defeated. Christianity, the <i>Denial of the Will to Live,</i> exalted to a religion! Luther was an impossible monk who, thanks to his own "impossibility," attacked the Church, and in so doing restored it! Catholics would be perfectly justified in celebrating feasts in honour of Luther, and in producing festival plays<a id="FNanchor_5_25"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_5_25" class="fnanchor pginternal">[5]</a> in his honour. Luther and the "rebirth of morality"! May all psychology go to the devil! Without a shadow of a doubt the Germans are idealists. On two occasions when, at the cost of enormous courage and self-control, an upright, unequivocal, and perfectly scientific attitude of mind had been attained, the Germans were able to discover back stairs leading down to the old "ideal" again, compromises between truth and the "ideal," and, in short, formulæ for the right to reject science and to perpetrate falsehoods. Leibniz and Kant—these two great breaks upon the intellectual honesty of Europe! Finally, at a moment when there appeared on the bridge that spanned two centuries of decadence, a superior force of genius and will which was strong enough to consolidate Europe and to convert it into a political and economic unit, with the object of ruling the world, the Germans, with their Wars of Independence, robbed Europe<a id="Page_126" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 126]"></a> of the significance—the marvellous significance, of Napoleon's life. And in so doing they laid on their conscience everything that followed, everything that exists to-day,—this sickliness and want of reason which is most opposed to culture, and which is called Nationalism,—this <i>névrose nationale</i> from which Europe is suffering acutely; this eternal subdivision of Europe into petty states, with politics on a municipal scale: they have robbed Europe itself of its significance, of its reason,—and have stuffed it into a cul-de-sac. Is there any one except me who knows the way out of this cul-de-sac? Does anyone except me know of an aspiration which would be great enough to bind the people of Europe once more together?</p>
<p class="parnum">3</p>
<p>And after all, why should I not express my suspicions? In my case, too, the Germans will attempt to make a great fate give birth merely to a mouse. Up to the present they have compromised themselves with me; I doubt whether the future will improve them. Alas! how happy I should be to prove a false prophet in this matter! My natural readers and listeners are already Russians, Scandinavians, and Frenchmen—will they always be the same? In the history of knowledge, Germans are represented only by doubtful names, they have been able to produce only "<i>unconscious</i>" swindlers (this word applies to Fichte, Schelling, Schopenhauer, Hegel, and Schleiermacher, just as well as to Kant or Leibniz; they were all mere<a id="Page_127" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 127]"></a> <i>Schleiermachers</i>).<a id="FNanchor_6_26"/><a href="7177551291719092937_52190-h-4.htm.html#Footnote_6_26" class="fnanchor pginternal">[6]</a> The Germans must not have the honour of seeing the first upright intellect in their history of intellects, that intellect in which truth ultimately got the better of the fraud of four thousand years, reckoned as one with the German intellect. "German intellect" is my foul air: I breathe with difficulty in the neighbourhood of this psychological uncleanliness that has now become instinctive—an uncleanliness which in every word and expression betrays a German. They have never undergone a seventeenth century of hard self-examination, as the French have,—a La Rochefoucauld, a Descartes, are a thousand times more upright than the very first among Germans,—the latter have not yet had any psychologists. But psychology is almost the standard of measurement for the cleanliness or uncleanliness of a race.... For if a man is not even clean, how can he be deep? The Germans are like women, you can scarcely ever I fathom their depths—they haven't any, and that's the end of it. Thus they cannot even be called shallow. That which is called "deep" in Germany, is precisely this instinctive uncleanliness towards one's self, of which I have just spoken: people refuse to be clear in regard to their own natures. Might I be allowed, perhaps, to suggest the word "German" as an international epithet denoting this psychological depravity?—At the moment of writing, for instance, the German Emperor is declaring it to be his Christian duty to liberate the slaves in Africa;<a id="Page_128" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 128]"></a> among us Europeans, then, this would be called simply "German." ... Have the Germans ever produced even a book that had depth? They are lacking in the mere idea of what constitutes a book. I have known scholars who thought that Kant was deep. At the Court of Prussia I fear that Herr von Treitschke is regarded as deep. And when I happen to praise Stendhal as a deep psychologist, I have often been compelled, in the company of German University Professors, to spell his name aloud.</p>
<p class="parnum">4</p>
<p>And why should I not proceed to the end? I am fond of clearing the air. It is even part of my ambition to be considered as essentially a despiser of Germans. I expressed my suspicions of the German character even at the age of six-and-twenty (see <i>Thoughts out of Season,</i> vol. ii. pp. 164, 165),—to my mind the Germans are impossible. When I try to think of the kind of man who is opposed to me in all my instincts, my mental image takes the form of a German. The first thing I ask myself when I begin analysing a man, is, whether he has a feeling for distance in him; whether he sees rank, gradation, and order everywhere between man and man; whether he makes distinctions; for this is what constitutes a gentleman. Otherwise he belongs hopelessly to that open-hearted, open-minded—alas! and always very good-natured species, <i>la canaille</i>! But the Germans are <i>canaille</i>—alas! they are so good-natured! A man lowers himself by frequenting the society of Germans: the German places every one on an equal footing. With the<a id="Page_129" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 129]"></a> exception of my intercourse with one or two artists, and above all with Richard Wagner, I cannot say that I have spent one pleasant hour with Germans. Suppose, for one moment, that the profoundest spirit of all ages were to appear among Germans, then one of the saviours of the Capitol would be sure to arise and declare that his own ugly soul was just as great. I can no longer abide this race with which a man is always in bad company, which; has no idea of nuances—woe to me! I am a nuance—and which has not <i>esprit</i> in its feet, and cannot even walk withal! In short, the Germans have no feet at all, they simply have legs. The Germans have not the faintest idea of how vulgar they are—but this in itself is the acme of vulgarity,—they are not even ashamed of being merely Germans. They will have their say in everything, they regard themselves as fit to decide all questions; I even fear that they have decided about me. My whole life is essentially a proof of this remark. In vain have I sought among them for a sign of tact and delicacy towards myself. Among Jews I did indeed find it, but not among Germans. I am so constituted as to be gentle and kindly to every one,—I have the right not to draw distinctions,—but this does not prevent my eyes from being open. I except no one, and least of all my friends,—I only trust that this has not prejudiced my reputation for humanity among them? There are five or six things which I have always made points of honour. Albeit, the truth remains that for many years I have considered almost every letter that has reached me as a piece of cynicism. There is more cynicism in an attitude<a id="Page_130" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 130]"></a> of goodwill towards me than in any sort of hatred. I tell every friend to his face that he has never thought it worth his while to <i>study</i> any one of my writings: from the slightest hints I gather that they do not even know what lies hidden in my books. And with regard even to my <i>Zarathustra,</i> which of my friends would have seen more in it than a piece of unwarrantable, though fortunately harmless, arrogance? Ten years have elapsed, and no one has yet felt it a duty to his conscience to defend my name against the absurd silence beneath which it has been entombed. It was a foreigner, a Dane, who first showed sufficient keenness of instinct and of courage to do this, and who protested indignantly against my so-called friends. At what German University to-day would such lectures on my philosophy be possible, as those which Dr. Brandes delivered last spring in Copenhagen, thus proving once more his right to the title psychologist? For my part, these things have never caused me any pain; that which is <i>necessary</i> does not offend me. <i>Amor fati</i> is the core of my nature. This, however, does not alter the fact that I love irony and even world-historic irony. And thus, about two years before hurling the destructive thunderbolt of the <i>Transvaluation,</i> which will send the whole of civilisation into convulsions, I sent my <i>Case of Wagner</i> out into the world. The Germans were given the chance of blundering and immortalising their stupidity once more on my account, and they still have just enough time to do it in. And have they fallen in with my plans? Admirably! my dear Germans. Allow me to congratulate you.</p>
