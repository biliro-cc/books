<h2><a id="canto100"/> Paradiso<br/>
Canto XXXIII</h2>
<p>«Vergine Madre, figlia del tuo figlio,<br/>
umile e alta più che creatura,<br/>
termine fisso d’etterno consiglio,</p>
<p>tu se’ colei che l’umana natura<br/>
nobilitasti sì, che ’l suo fattore<br/>
non disdegnò di farsi sua fattura.</p>
<p>Nel ventre tuo si raccese l’amore,<br/>
per lo cui caldo ne l’etterna pace<br/>
così è germinato questo fiore.</p>
<p>Qui se’ a noi meridïana face<br/>
di caritate, e giuso, intra ’ mortali,<br/>
se’ di speranza fontana vivace.</p>
<p>Donna, se’ tanto grande e tanto vali,<br/>
che qual vuol grazia e a te non ricorre,<br/>
sua disïanza vuol volar sanz’ ali.</p>
<p>La tua benignità non pur soccorre<br/>
a chi domanda, ma molte fïate<br/>
liberamente al dimandar precorre.</p>
<p>In te misericordia, in te pietate,<br/>
in te magnificenza, in te s’aduna<br/>
quantunque in creatura è di bontate.</p>
<p>Or questi, che da l’infima lacuna<br/>
de l’universo infin qui ha vedute<br/>
le vite spiritali ad una ad una,</p>
<p>supplica a te, per grazia, di virtute<br/>
tanto, che possa con li occhi levarsi<br/>
più alto verso l’ultima salute.</p>
<p>E io, che mai per mio veder non arsi<br/>
più ch’i’ fo per lo suo, tutti miei prieghi<br/>
ti porgo, e priego che non sieno scarsi,</p>
<p>perché tu ogne nube li disleghi<br/>
di sua mortalità co’ prieghi tuoi,<br/>
sì che ’l sommo piacer li si dispieghi.</p>
<p>Ancor ti priego, regina, che puoi<br/>
ciò che tu vuoli, che conservi sani,<br/>
dopo tanto veder, li affetti suoi.</p>
<p>Vinca tua guardia i movimenti umani:<br/>
vedi Beatrice con quanti beati<br/>
per li miei prieghi ti chiudon le mani!».</p>
<p>Li occhi da Dio diletti e venerati,<br/>
fissi ne l’orator, ne dimostraro<br/>
quanto i devoti prieghi le son grati;</p>
<p>indi a l’etterno lume s’addrizzaro,<br/>
nel qual non si dee creder che s’invii<br/>
per creatura l’occhio tanto chiaro.</p>
<p>E io ch’al fine di tutt’ i disii<br/>
appropinquava, sì com’ io dovea,<br/>
l’ardor del desiderio in me finii.</p>
<p>Bernardo m’accennava, e sorridea,<br/>
perch’ io guardassi suso; ma io era<br/>
già per me stesso tal qual ei volea:</p>
<p>ché la mia vista, venendo sincera,<br/>
e più e più intrava per lo raggio<br/>
de l’alta luce che da sé è vera.</p>
<p>Da quinci innanzi il mio veder fu maggio<br/>
che ’l parlar mostra, ch’a tal vista cede,<br/>
e cede la memoria a tanto oltraggio.</p>
<p>Qual è colüi che sognando vede,<br/>
che dopo ’l sogno la passione impressa<br/>
rimane, e l’altro a la mente non riede,</p>
<p>cotal son io, ché quasi tutta cessa<br/>
mia visïone, e ancor mi distilla<br/>
nel core il dolce che nacque da essa.</p>
<p>Così la neve al sol si disigilla;<br/>
così al vento ne le foglie levi<br/>
si perdea la sentenza di Sibilla.</p>
<p>O somma luce che tanto ti levi<br/>
da’ concetti mortali, a la mia mente<br/>
ripresta un poco di quel che parevi,</p>
<p>e fa la lingua mia tanto possente,<br/>
ch’una favilla sol de la tua gloria<br/>
possa lasciare a la futura gente;</p>
<p>ché, per tornare alquanto a mia memoria<br/>
e per sonare un poco in questi versi,<br/>
più si conceperà di tua vittoria.</p>
<p>Io credo, per l’acume ch’io soffersi<br/>
del vivo raggio, ch’i’ sarei smarrito,<br/>
se li occhi miei da lui fossero aversi.</p>
<p>E’ mi ricorda ch’io fui più ardito<br/>
per questo a sostener, tanto ch’i’ giunsi<br/>
l’aspetto mio col valore infinito.</p>
<p>Oh abbondante grazia ond’ io presunsi<br/>
ficcar lo viso per la luce etterna,<br/>
tanto che la veduta vi consunsi!</p>
<p>Nel suo profondo vidi che s’interna,<br/>
legato con amore in un volume,<br/>
ciò che per l’universo si squaderna:</p>
<p>sustanze e accidenti e lor costume<br/>
quasi conflati insieme, per tal modo<br/>
che ciò ch’i’ dico è un semplice lume.</p>
<p>La forma universal di questo nodo<br/>
credo ch’i’ vidi, perché più di largo,<br/>
dicendo questo, mi sento ch’i’ godo.</p>
<p>Un punto solo m’è maggior letargo<br/>
che venticinque secoli a la ’mpresa<br/>
che fé Nettuno ammirar l’ombra d’Argo.</p>
<p>Così la mente mia, tutta sospesa,<br/>
mirava fissa, immobile e attenta,<br/>
e sempre di mirar faceasi accesa.</p>
<p>A quella luce cotal si diventa,<br/>
che volgersi da lei per altro aspetto<br/>
è impossibil che mai si consenta;</p>
<p>però che ’l ben, ch’è del volere obietto,<br/>
tutto s’accoglie in lei, e fuor di quella<br/>
è defettivo ciò ch’è lì perfetto.</p>
<p>Omai sarà più corta mia favella,<br/>
pur a quel ch’io ricordo, che d’un fante<br/>
che bagni ancor la lingua a la mammella.</p>
<p>Non perché più ch’un semplice sembiante<br/>
fosse nel vivo lume ch’io mirava,<br/>
che tal è sempre qual s’era davante;</p>
<p>ma per la vista che s’avvalorava<br/>
in me guardando, una sola parvenza,<br/>
mutandom’ io, a me si travagliava.</p>
<p>Ne la profonda e chiara sussistenza<br/>
de l’alto lume parvermi tre giri<br/>
di tre colori e d’una contenenza;</p>
<p>e l’un da l’altro come iri da iri<br/>
parea reflesso, e ’l terzo parea foco<br/>
che quinci e quindi igualmente si spiri.</p>
<p>Oh quanto è corto il dire e come fioco<br/>
al mio concetto! e questo, a quel ch’i’ vidi,<br/>
è tanto, che non basta a dicer ‘poco’.</p>
<p>O luce etterna che sola in te sidi,<br/>
sola t’intendi, e da te intelletta<br/>
e intendente te ami e arridi!</p>
<p>Quella circulazion che sì concetta<br/>
pareva in te come lume reflesso,<br/>
da li occhi miei alquanto circunspetta,</p>
<p>dentro da sé, del suo colore stesso,<br/>
mi parve pinta de la nostra effige:<br/>
per che ’l mio viso in lei tutto era messo.</p>
<p>Qual è ’l geomètra che tutto s’affige<br/>
per misurar lo cerchio, e non ritrova,<br/>
pensando, quel principio ond’ elli indige,</p>
<p>tal era io a quella vista nova:<br/>
veder voleva come si convenne<br/>
l’imago al cerchio e come vi s’indova;</p>
<p>ma non eran da ciò le proprie penne:<br/>
se non che la mia mente fu percossa<br/>
da un fulgore in che sua voglia venne.</p>
<p>A l’alta fantasia qui mancò possa;<br/>
ma già volgeva il mio disio e ’l velle,<br/>
sì come rota ch’igualmente è mossa,</p>
<p>l’amor che move il sole e l’altre stelle.</p>

<div class="c2">1.F.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from.

<div class="c2">1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</div>
<div class="c2">1.F.6.

<div class="c11">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</div>
<div class="c2">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</div>
<div class="c11">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>
<div class="c2">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</div>
<div class="c2">The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</div>
<div class="c11">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</div>
<div class="c2">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</div>
<div class="c2">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</div>
<div class="c2">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</div>
<div class="c2">Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</div>
<div class="c11">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</div>
<div class="c2">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</div>
<div class="c2">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</div>
<div class="c2">Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</div>
<div class="c2">This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</div>
