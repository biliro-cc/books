<h3><a/> Inferno<br/>
Canto XXXII</h3>
<p id="id00699">If I had rhymes both harsh and raucous, such as would befit the
dismal hole on which thrust<sup>1</sup> all the other rocks, I would
press out the juice of my conception more fully; but since I have
them not, not without fear I bring myself to speak; for to
describe the bottom of the whole universe is no enterprise to
take up in jest, nor a tongue that cries mamma or babbo. But
may those Dames aid my verse who aided Amphion to close in
Thebes; so that from the fact the speech be not diverse.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00700"><sup>1</sup> Rest their weight.</p>

<p id="id00701">O populace miscreant above all, that art in the place whereof to
speak is hard, better had ye been here<sup>1</sup> or sheep or goats!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00702"><sup>1</sup> On earth.</p>

<p id="id00703">When we were down in the dark abyss beneath the feet of the
giant, but far lower, and I was gazing still at the high wall, I
heard say to me, "Beware how thou steppest; take heed thou
trample not with thy soles the heads of the wretched weary
brethren." Whereat I turned, and saw before me, and under my
feet, a lake which through frost had semblance of glass and not
of water.</p>

<p id="id00704">The Danube in Austria makes not for its current so thick a veil
in winter, nor the Don yonder under the cold sky, as there was
here; for if Tambernich <sup>1</sup> had fallen thereupon, or
Pietrapana,<sup>2</sup> it would not even at the edge have given a creak.
And as to croak the frog lies with muzzle out of the water, what
time<sup>3</sup> oft dreams the peasant girl of gleaning, so, livid up to
where shame appears,<sup>4</sup> were the woeful shades within the ice,
setting their teeth to the note of the stork.<sup>5</sup> Every one held
his face turned downward; from the mouth the cold, and from the
eyes the sad heart compels witness of itself among them.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00705"><sup>1</sup> A mountain, the locality of which is unknown.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00706"><sup>2</sup> One of the Toscan Apennines.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00707"><sup>3</sup> In summer.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00708"><sup>4</sup> Up to the face.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00709"><sup>5</sup> Chattering with cold.</p>

<p id="id00710">When I had looked round awhile, I turned to my feet, and saw two
so close that they had the hair of their heads mixed together.
"Tell me, ye who so press tight your breasts," said I, "who are
ye?" And they bent their necks, and after they had raised their
faces to rue, their eyes, which before were moist only within,
gushed up through the lids, and the frost bound the tears between
them, and locked them up again. Clamp never girt board to board
so strongly; wherefore they like two he goats butted together,
such anger overcame them.</p>

<p id="id00711">And one who had lost both his ears through the cold, still with
his face downward, said to me, "Why dost thou so mirror thyself
on us? If thou wouldst know who are these two, the valley whence
the Bisenzio descends belonged to their father Albert, and to
them.<sup>1</sup> From one body they issued, and all Caina<sup>2</sup> thou mayst
search, and thou wilt not find shade more worthy to be fixed in
ice; not he whose breast and shadow were broken by one and the
same blow by the hand of Arthur;<sup>3</sup> not Focaccia;<sup>4</sup> not he who
encumbers me with his head, so that I cannot see beyond, and was
named Sassol Mascheroni:<sup>5</sup> if thou art Tuscan, well knowest thou
now who he was. And that thou mayst not put me to more speech,
know that I was Camicion de' Pazzi,<sup>6</sup> and I await Carlino that
he may exonerate me."</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00712"><sup>1</sup> They were of the Alberti, counts of Mangona, in Tuscany, and
had killed each other.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00713"><sup>2</sup> The first division of this ninth and lowest circle of Hell.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00714"><sup>3</sup> Mordred, the traitorous son of Arthur.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00715"><sup>4</sup> From the crimes of Focaccia, a member of the great
Cancellieri family of Pistoia, began the feud of the Black and
the White factions, which long raged in Pistoia and in Florence.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00716"><sup>5</sup> A Florentine who murdered his nephew for an inheritance.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00717"><sup>6</sup> A murderer of one of his kinsmen, whose crime was surpassed
by that of Carlino de' Pazzi, who, in 1302, betrayed a band of
the Florentine exiles who had taken refuge in a stronghold of his
in Valdarno.</p>

<p id="id00718">Then I saw a thousand faces made currish by the cold, whence
shuddering comes to me, and will always come, at frozen pools.</p>

<p id="id00719">And while we were going toward the centre<sup>1</sup> to which tends every
weight, and I was trembling in the eternal shade, whether it was
will or destiny, or fortune I know not, but, walking among the
heads, I struck my foot hard in the face of one. Wailing he cried
out to me, "Why dost thou trample me? If thou comest not to
increase the vengeance of Mont' Aperti, why dost thou molest me?"
And I, "My Master, now wait here for me, so that I may free me
from a doubt by means of this one, then thou shalt make me hasten
as much as thou wilt." The Leader stopped, and I said to that
shade who was bitterly blaspheming still, "Who art thou that thus
railest at another?" "Now thou, who art thou, that goest through
the Antenora,"<sup>2</sup> he answered, "smiting the cheeks of others, so
that if thou wert alive, it would be too much?" "Alive I am, and
it may be dear to thee," was my reply, "if thou demandest fame,
that I should set thy name amid the other notes." And he to me,
"For the contrary do I long; take thyself hence, and give me no
more trouble, for ill thou knowest to flatter on this plain."
Then I took him by the hair of the crown, and said, "It shall
needs be that thou name thyself, or that not a hair remain upon
thee here." Whereon he to me, "Though thou strip me of hair, I
will not tell thee who I am, nor will I show it to thee if a
thousand times thou fallest on my head."</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00720"><sup>1</sup> The centre of the earth.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00721"><sup>2</sup> The second division of the ninth circle; so named after the
Trojan who, though of good repute in Homer, was charged by a
later tradition with having betrayed Troy.</p>

<p id="id00722">I already had his hair twisted in my hand, and had pulled out
more than one shock, he barking, with his eyes kept close down,
when another cried out, "What ails thee, Bocca?<sup>1</sup> Is it not
enough for thee to make music with thy jaws, but thou must bark?
What devil has hold of thee?" "Now," said I, "I would not have
thee speak, accursed traitor, for to thy shame will I carry true
news of thee." "Begone," he answered, "and relate what thou wilt,
but be not silent, if from here within thou goest forth, of him
who now had his tongue so ready. He weeps here the money of the
French; I saw, thou canst say, him of Duera,<sup>2</sup> there where the
sinners stand cooling. Shouldst thou be asked who else was there,
thou hast at thy side that Beccheria <sup>3</sup> whose gorget Florence
cut. Gianni del Soldanier <sup>4</sup> I think is farther on with
Ganellon<sup>5</sup> and Tribaldello,<sup>6</sup> who opened Faenza when it
was sleeping."</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00723"><sup>1</sup> Bocca degli Abati, the most noted of Florentine traitors, who
in the heat of the battle of Mont' Aperti, in 1260, cut off the
hand of the standard-bearer of the cavalry, so that the standard
fell, and the Guelphs of Florence, disheartened thereby, were put
to rout with frightful slaughter.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00724"><sup>2</sup> Buoso da Duera of Cremona, who, for a bribe, let pass near
Parma, without resistance, the cavalry of Charles of Anjou, led
by Gui de Montfort to the conquest of Naples in 1265.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00725"><sup>3</sup> Tesauro de' Beccheria, Abbot of Vallombrosa, and Papal
Legato, beheaded by the Florentines in 1258, because of his
treacherous dealings with the exiled Ghibellines.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00726"><sup>4</sup> A Ghibelline leader, who, after the defeat of Manfred in
1266, plotted against his own party.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00727"><sup>5</sup> Ganellon, the traitor who brought about the defeat at
Roncesvalles.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="id00728"><sup>6</sup> He betrayed Faenza to the French, in 1282.</p>

<p id="id00729">We had now parted from him when I saw two frozen in one hole, so
that the head of one was a hood for the other. And as bread is
devoured in hunger, so the uppermost one set his teeth upon the
other where the brain joins with the nape. Not otherwise Tydeus
gnawed for spite the temples of Menalippus than this one did the
skull and the other parts. "O thou! that by so bestial a sign
showest hatred against him whom thou dost eat, tell me the
wherefore," said I, "with this compact, that if thou rightfully
of him complainest, I, knowing who ye are, and his sin, may yet
recompense thee for it in the world above, if that with which I
speak be not dried up."</p>
