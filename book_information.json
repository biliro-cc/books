It was Leo Tolstoy\u2019s second novel, coming after War and Peace and further cementing his role as the primary Russian author of his age.

This edition is the well-received 1912 English translation by Constance Garnett. As well as earning wide-spread critical acclaim, the novel has been widely influential in literary and philosophical circles; Franz Kafka and James Joyce admired the emotions that verge on madness in the Karamazovs, while Sigmund Freud and Jean-Paul Satre found inspiration in the themes of patricide and existentialism. \u2014 Standard Ebooks",
