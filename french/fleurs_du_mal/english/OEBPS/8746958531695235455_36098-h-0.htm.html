<h3 id="pgepubid00004"><a id="Benediction"/>Benediction</h3>
<p class="margin-b"><span class="c4">When by the changeless Power of a Supreme Decree</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The poet issues forth upon this sorry sphere,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">His mother, horrified, and full of blasphemy,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Uplifts her voice to God, who takes compassion on her.</span><br/>
<br/>
"Ah, why did I not bear a serpent's nest entire,<br/>
<span class="c4">Instead of bringing forth this hideous Child of Doom!</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Oh cursèd be that transient night of vain desire</span><br/>
<span class="c4">When I conceived my expiation in my womb!"</span><br/>
<br/>
"Yet since among all women thou hast chosen me<br/>
<span class="c4">To be the degradation of my jaded mate,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And since I cannot like a love-leaf wantonly</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Consign this stunted monster to the glowing grate,"</span><br/>
<br/>
"I'll cause thine overwhelming hatred to rebound<br/>
<span class="c4">Upon the cursèd tool of thy most wicked spite.</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Forsooth, the branches of this wretched tree I'll wound</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And rob its pestilential blossoms of their might!"</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c4">So thus, she giveth vent unto her foaming ire,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And knowing not the changeless statutes of all times,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Herself, amid the flames of hell, prepares the pyre;</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The consecrated penance of maternal crimes.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c4">Yet 'neath th' invisible shelter of an Angel's wing</span><br/>
<span class="c4">This sunlight-loving infant disinherited,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Exhales from all he eats and drinks, and everything</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The ever sweet ambrosia and the nectar red.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c4">He trifles with the winds and with the clouds that glide,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">About the way unto the Cross, he loves to sing,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The spirit on his pilgrimage; that faithful guide,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Oft weeps to see him joyful like a bird of Spring.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c4">All those that he would cherish shrink from him with fear,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And some that waxen bold by his tranquility,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Endeavour hard some grievance from his heart to tear,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And make on him the trial of their ferocity.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c4">Within the bread and wine outspread for his repast</span><br/>
<span class="c4">To mingle dust and dirty spittle they essay,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And everything he touches, forth they slyly cast,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Or scourge themselves, if e'er their feet betrod his way.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c4">His wife goes round proclaiming in the crowded quads—</span><br/>
"Since he can find my body beauteous to behold,<br/>
<span class="c4">Why not perform the office of those ancient gods</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And like unto them, redeck myself with shining gold?"</span><br/>
<br/>
"I'll bathe myself with incense, spikenard and myrrh,<br/>
<span class="c4">With genuflexions, delicate viandes and wine,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">To see, in jest, if from a heart, that loves me dear,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">I cannot filch away the hommages divine."</span><br/>
<br/>
"And when of these impious jokes at length I tire,<br/>
<span class="c4">My frail but mighty hands, around his breast entwined,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">With nails, like harpies' nails, shall cunningly conspire</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The hidden path unto his feeble heart to find."</span><br/>
<br/>
"And like a youngling bird that trembles in its nest,<br/>
<span class="c4">I'll pluck his heart right out; within its own blood drowned,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And finally to satiate my favourite beast,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">I'll throw it with intense disdain upon the ground!"</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="c4">Towards the Heavens where he sees the sacred grail</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The poet calmly stretches forth his pious arms,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Whereon the lightenings from his lucid spirit veil</span><br/>
<span class="c4">The sight of the infuriated mob that swarms.</span><br/>
<br/>
"Oh blest be thou, Almighty who bestowest pain,<br/>
<span class="c4">Like some divine redress for our infirmities,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">And like the most refreshing and the purest rain,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">To sanctify the strong, for saintly ecstasies."</span><br/>
<br/>
"I know that for the poet thou wilt grant a chair,<br/>
<span class="c4">Among the Sainted Legion and the Blissful ones,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">That of the endless feast thou wilt accord his share</span><br/>
<span class="c4">To him, of Virtues, Dominations and of Thrones."</span><br/>
<br/>
"I know, that Sorrow is that nobleness alone,<br/>
<span class="c4">Which never may corrupted be by hell nor curse,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">I know, in order to enwreathe my mystic crown</span><br/>
<span class="c4">I must inspire the ages and the universe."</span><br/>
<br/>
"And yet the buried jewels of Palmyra old,<br/>
<span class="c4">The undiscovered metals and the pearly sea</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Of gems, that unto me you show could never hold</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Beside this diadem of blinding brilliancy."</span><br/>
<br/>
"For it shall be engendered from the purest fire<br/>
<span class="c4">Of rays primeval, from the holy hearth amassed,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Of which the eyes of Mortals, in their sheen entire,</span><br/>
<span class="c4">Are but the tarnished mirrors, sad and overcast!"</span><br/></p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00005"><a id="Echoes"/>Echoes</h3>
<p class="margin-b">In Nature's temple, living columns rise,<br/>
Which oftentimes give tongue to words subdued,<br/>
And Man traverses this symbolic wood,<br/>
Which looks at him with half familiar eyes,<br/>
<br/>
Like lingering echoes, which afar confound<br/>
Themselves in deep and sombre unity,<br/>
As vast as Night, and like transplendency,<br/>
The scents and colours to each other respond.<br/>
<br/>
And scents there are, like infant's flesh as chaste,<br/>
As sweet as oboes, and as meadows fair,<br/>
And others, proud, corrupted, rich and vast,<br/>
<br/>
Which have the expansion of infinity,<br/>
Like amber, musk and frankincense and myrrh,<br/>
That sing the soul's and senses' ecstasy.<br/></p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00006"><a id="The_Sick_Muse"/>The Sick Muse</h3>
<p class="margin-b">Alas—my poor Muse—what aileth thee now?<br/>
Thine eyes are bedimmed with the visions of Night,<br/>
And silent and cold—I perceive on thy brow<br/>
In their turns—Despair and Madness alight.<br/>
<br/>
A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red,<br/>
Has it poured o'er thee Horror and Love from its urn?<br/>
Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing hath led<br/>
Thee to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne?<br/>
<br/>
I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull,<br/>
That thy breast with strong thoughts could for ever be full,<br/>
And that rhymthmic'ly flowing—thy Christian blood<br/>
<br/>
Could resemble the olden-time metrical-flood,<br/>
Where each in his turn reigned the father of Rhymes<br/>
Phoebus—and Pan, lord of Harvest-times.<br/></p>
<hr class="c5"/>
<h3 id="pgepubid00007"><a id="The_Venal_Muse"/>The Venal Muse</h3>
<p class="margin-b">Oh Muse of my heart—so fond of palaces old,<br/>
Wilt have—when New Year speeds its wintry blast,<br/>
Amid those tedious nights, with snow o'ercast,<br/>
A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold?<br/>
<br/>
Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive<br/>
With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep?<br/>
And—void thy purse and void thy palace—reap<br/>
A golden hoard within some azure hive?<br/>
<br/>
Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night,<br/>
Suspend the censer like an acolyte,<br/>
Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease,<br/>
<br/>
Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene<br/>
Essay to lull the vulgar rabble's spleen;<br/>
Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees.<br/></p>

<p class="margin-b">The cloisters old, expounded on their walls<br/>
With paintings, the Beatic Verity,<br/>
The which—adorning their religious halls,<br/>
Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity.<br/>
<br/>
In days when Christian seeds bloomed o'er the land,<br/>
Full many a noble monk unknown to-day,<br/>
Upon the field of tombs would take his stand,<br/>
Exalting Death in rude and simple way.<br/>
<br/>
My soul is a tomb where—bad monk that I be—<br/>
I dwell and search its depths from all eternity,<br/>
And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot.<br/>
<br/>
Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright<br/>
From the living spectacle of my bitter lot,<br/>
To mold my handywork and mine eyes' Delight?<br/></p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00009"><a id="The_Enemy"/>The Enemy</h3>
<p class="margin-b">My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm,<br/>
Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun;<br/>
The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm<br/>
That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one.<br/>
<br/>
Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached,<br/>
And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume,<br/>
In collecting the turf, inundated and breached,<br/>
Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb.<br/>
<br/>
And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved,<br/>
Will they find in this earth—like a shore that is laved—<br/>
The mystical fuel which vigour imparts?<br/>
<br/>
Oh misery!—Time devours our lives,<br/>
And the enemy black, which consumeth our hearts<br/>
On the blood of our bodies, increases and thrives!<br/></p>

<p class="margin-b">This heavy burden to uplift,<br/>
O Sysiphus, thy pluck is required!<br/>
And even though the heart aspired,<br/>
Art is long and Time is swift.<br/>
<br/>
Afar from sepulchres renowned,<br/>
To a graveyard, quite apart,<br/>
Like a broken drum, my heart,<br/>
Beats the funeral marches' sound.<br/>
<br/>
Many a buried jewel sleeps<br/>
In the long-forgotten deeps,<br/>
Far from mattock and from sound;<br/>
<br/>
Many a flower wafts aloft<br/>
Its perfumes, like a secret soft,<br/>
Within the solitudes, profound.<br/></p>
<hr class="c5"/>
<h3 id="pgepubid00011"><a id="Interior_Life"/>Interior Life</h3>
<p class="margin-b">A long while I dwelt beneath vast porticoes,<br/>
While the ocean-suns bathed with a thousand fires,<br/>
And which with their great and majestic spires,<br/>
At eventide looked like basaltic grottoes.<br/>
<br/>
The billows, in rolling depictured the skies,<br/>
And mingled, in solemn and mystical strain,<br/>
The all-mighteous chords of their luscious refrain<br/>
With the sun-set's colours reflexed in mine eyes.<br/>
<br/>
It is there that I lived in exalted calm,<br/>
In the midst of the azure, the splendour, the waves,<br/>
While pregnant with perfumes, naked slaves<br/>
<br/>
Refreshed my forehead with branches of palm,<br/>
Whose gentle and only care was to know<br/>
The secret that caused me to languish so.<br/></p>

<p class="margin-b">Free man! the sea is to thee ever dear!<br/>
The sea is thy mirror, thou regardest thy soul<br/>
In its mighteous waves that unendingly roll,<br/>
And thy spirit is yet not a chasm less drear.<br/>
<br/>
Thou delight'st to plunge deep in thine image down;<br/>
Thou tak'st it with eyes and with arms in embrace,<br/>
And at times thine own inward voice would'st efface<br/>
With the sound of its savage ungovernable moan.<br/>
<br/>
You are both of you, sombre, secretive and deep:<br/>
Oh mortal, thy depths are foraye unexplored,<br/>
Oh sea—no one knoweth thy dazzling hoard,<br/>
You both are so jealous your secrets to keep!<br/>
<br/>
And endless ages have wandered by,<br/>
Yet still without pity or mercy you fight,<br/>
So mighty in plunder and death your delight:<br/>

The poets in front of mine attitudes fine<br/>

And grow, unchained, in awe-inspiring art,<br/>
Within the mists across her eyes that stole<br/>
To divine the fires entombed within her heart.<br/>
<br/>
And oft to scramble o'er her mighty limbs,<br/>
And climb the slopes of her enormous knees,<br/>
Or in summer when the scorching sunlight streams<br/>
<br/>
Across the country, to recline at ease,<br/>
And slumber in the shadow of her breast<br/>

Thy look containeth both the dawn and sunset stars,<br/>
Thy perfumes, as upon a sultry night exhale,<br/>
Thy kiss a philter, and thy mouth a Grecian vase,<br/>
That renders heroes cowardly and infants hale.<br/>

Yea, art thou from the planets, or the fiery womb?<br/>
The demon follows in thy train, with magic fraught,<br/>
Thou scatter'st seeds haphazardly of joy and doom,<br/>
Thou govern'st everything, but answer'st unto nought.<br/>
<br/>
O Loveliness! thou spurnest corpses with delight,<br/>
Among thy jewels, Horror hath such charms for thee,<br/>
And Murder 'mid thy mostly cherished trinklets bright,<br/>
Upon thy massive bosom dances amorously.<br/>
<br/>
The blinded, fluttering moth towards the candle flies,<br/>
Then frizzles, falls, and falters—"Blessings unto thee"—<br/>
The panting swain that o'er his beauteous mistress sighs,<br/>
Seems like the Sick, that stroke their gravestones lovingly.<br/>
<br/>
What matter, if thou comest from the Heavens or Hell,<br/>
O Beauty, frightful ghoul, ingenuous and obscure!<br/>
So long thine eyes, thy smile, to me the way can tell<br/>
Towards that Infinite I love, but never saw.<br/>
<br/>
From God or Satan? Angel, Mermaid, Proserpine?<br/>
What matter if thou makest—blithe, voluptuous sprite—<br/>
With rhythms, perfumes, visions—O mine only queen!—<br/>
The universe less hideous and the hours less trite.<br/></p>

Her polished eyes are made of minerals bright,<br/>

Oh, say! it is true that Agatha's desolate heart,<br/>
Proclaimeth, "Away from remorse, and from crimes, and from cares,"<br/>
Oh, carry me, waggons, oh, sailing ships, help me depart!<br/>
<br/>
How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields!<br/>
Wherein there is nothing but sunshine and love and glee;<br/>
Where all that one loves is so worthy, and lovingly yields,<br/>
And our hearts float about in the purest of ecstasy,<br/>
How distant you seem to be, perfumed Elysian fields!<br/>
<br/>
But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves,<br/>
The strolls, and the songs, and the kisses, and bunches of flowers,<br/>
The viols vibrating beyond, in the mountainous groves,<br/>
With the chalice of wine and the evening, entwined, in the bowers,<br/>
But the green paradise of those transient infantile loves.<br/>
<br/>
That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight,<br/>
Than China or India, is it still further away?<br/>
Or, could one with pityful prayers bring it back to our sight?<br/>
Or yet with a silvery voice o'er the ages convey<br/>
That innocent heaven o'erflowing with furtive delight!<br/></p>

She slyly lets trickle a furtive tear,<br/>
