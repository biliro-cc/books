</div>
<p>To which the women replied from the interior, in falsetto, in doleful tones:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Mon père est en chagrin, ma mère en grand' tristesse,<br/></span> <span>Et moi je suis fille de trop grand' merci<br/></span> <span>Pour ouvrir ma porte à <i>cette heure ici</i>."<a id="FNanchor_4_4"/><a href="3626861088260803644_12816-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_4_4" class="pginternal"><sup>[4]</sup></a><br/></span></div>
</div>
<p>The men repeated the first stanza down to the fourth line, which they modified thus:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"J'ons un beau mouchoir à vous présenter."<a id="FNanchor_5_5"/><a href="3626861088260803644_12816-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_5_5" class="pginternal"><sup>[5]</sup></a><br/></span></div>
</div>
<p>But the women replied, in the name of the bride, in the same words as before.</p>
<p>Through twenty stanzas, at least, the men enumerated all the gifts in the <i>livrée</i>, always mentioning a new article in the last verse: a beautiful <i>devanteau</i>,—apron,—lovely ribbons, a cloth dress, lace, a gold cross, even to <i>a hundred pins</i> to complete the bride's modest outfit. The matrons invariably refused; but at last the young men decided to mention <i>a handsome husband to offer</i>, and they replied by addressing the bride, and singing to her with the men:</p>

<h2>THE WEDDING</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The hemp-beater at once drew the wooden latch by which the door was fastened on the inside; at that time, it was still the only lock known in most of the houses in our village. The bridegroom's party invaded the bride's dwelling, but not without a combat; for the boys stationed inside the house, and even the old hemp-beater and the old women, made it their duty to defend the hearthstone. The bearer of the spit, supported by his adherents, was bound to succeed in bestowing his bird in the fire-place. It was a genuine battle, although they abstained from striking one another, and there was no anger in it. But they pushed and squeezed one another with such violence, and there was so much self-esteem at stake in that conflict of muscular strength, that the results might be more serious than they seemed to be amid the laughter and the singing. The poor old hemp-beater, who fought like a lion, was pressed against the wall and squeezed until he lost his breath. More than one champion was floored and unintentionally trodden under foot, more than one hand that grasped at the spit was covered with blood. Those sports are dangerous, and the accidents were so serious in later years that the peasants determined to allow the ceremony of the <i>livrées</i> to fall into desuetude. I believe that we saw the last of it at Françoise Meillant's wedding, and still it was only a mock-battle.</p>
<p>The contest was animated enough at Germain's wedding. It was a point of honor on one side and the other to attack and to defend La Guillette's fireside. The huge spit was twisted like a screw in the powerful hands that struggled for possession of it. A pistol-shot set fire to a small store of hemp in skeins that lay on a shelf suspended from the ceiling. That incident created a diversion, and while some hastened to smother the germ of a conflagration, the grave-digger, who had climbed to the attic unperceived, came down the chimney and seized the spit, just as the drover, who was defending it near the hearth, raised it above his head to prevent its being snatched from him. Some time before the assault, the matrons had taken care to put out the fire, fearing that some one might fall in and be burned while they were struggling close beside it. The facetious grave-digger, in concert with the drover, possessed himself of the trophy without difficulty, therefore, and threw it across the fire-dogs. It was done! No one was allowed to touch it after that. He leaped into the room, and lighted a bit of straw which surrounded the spit, to make a pretence of cooking the goose, which was torn to pieces and its limbs strewn over the floor.</p>
<p>Thereupon, there was much laughter and burlesque discussion. Every one showed the bruises he had received, and as it was often the hand of a friend that had dealt the blow, there was no complaining or quarrelling. The hemp-beater, who was half flattened out, rubbed his sides, saying that he cared very little for that, but that he did protest against the stratagem of his good friend the grave-digger, and that, if he had not been half-dead, the hearth would not have been conquered so easily. The matrons swept the floor, and order was restored. The table was covered with jugs of new wine. When they had drank together and recovered their breath, the bridegroom was led into the centre of the room, and, being armed with a staff, was obliged to submit to a new test.</p>
<p>During the contest, the bride had been concealed with three of her friends by her mother, her godmother, and aunts, who had seated the four girls on a bench in the farthest corner of the room, and covered them over with a great white sheet. They had selected three of Marie's friends who were of the same height as she, and wore caps of exactly the same height, so that, as the sheet covered their heads and descended to their feet, it was impossible to distinguish them from each other.</p>
<p>The bridegroom was not allowed to touch them, except with the end of his wand, and only to point out the one whom he judged to be his wife. They gave him time to examine them, but only with his eyes, and the matrons, who stood by his side, watched closely to see that there was no cheating. If he made a mistake, he could not dance with his betrothed during the evening, but only with her whom he had chosen by mistake.</p>
<p>Germain, finding himself in the presence of those phantoms enveloped in the same winding-sheet, was terribly afraid of making a mistake; and, as a matter of fact, that had happened to many others, for the precautions were always taken with scrupulous care. His heart beat fast. Little Marie tried to breathe hard and make the sheet move, but her mischievous rivals did the same, pushed out the cloth with their fingers, and there were as many mysterious signs as there were girls under the veil. The square caps kept the veil so perfectly level that it was impossible to distinguish the shape of a head beneath its folds.</p>
<p>Germain, after ten minutes of hesitation, closed his eyes, commended his soul to God, and stuck his staff out at random. He touched little Marie's forehead, and she threw the sheet aside with a cry of triumph. He obtained leave then to kiss her, and, taking her in his strong arms, he carried her to the middle of the room, and with her opened the ball, which lasted until two o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Then they separated to meet again at eight o'clock. As there was a considerable number of young people from the neighboring towns, and as there were not beds enough for everybody, each invited guest among the women of the village shared her bed with two or three friends, while the young men lay pell-mell on the hay in the loft at the farm. You can imagine that there was not much sleep there, for they thought of nothing but teasing, and playing tricks on one another and telling amusing stories. At all weddings, there are three sleepless nights, which no one regrets.</p>
<p>At the hour appointed for setting out, after they had eaten their soup <i>au lait</i> seasoned with a strong dose of pepper to give them an appetite, for the wedding-banquet bade fair to be abundant, they assembled in the farm-yard. Our parish church being suppressed, they were obliged to go half a league away to receive the nuptial benediction. It was a lovely, cool day; but, as the roads were very bad, every man had provided himself with a horse, and took <i>en croupe</i> a female companion, young or old. Germain was mounted upon Grise, who, being well groomed, newly shod, and decked out in ribbons, pranced and capered and breathed fire through her nostrils. He went to the cabin for his fiancée, accompanied by his brother-in-law Jacques, who was mounted on old Grise and took Mère Guillette <i>en croupe</i>, while Germain returned triumphantly to the farm-yard with his dear little wife.</p>
<p>Then the merry cavalcade set forth, escorted by children on foot, who fired pistols as they ran and made the horses jump. Mère Maurice was riding in a small cart with Germain's three children and the fiddlers. They opened the march to the sound of the instruments. Petit-Pierre was so handsome that the old grandmother was immensely proud. But the impulsive child did not stay long beside her. He took advantage of a halt they were obliged to make, when they had gone half the distance, in order to pass a difficult ford, to slip down and ask his father to take him up on Grise in front of him.</p>
<p>"No, no!" said Germain, "that will make people say unkind things about us! you mustn't do it."</p>
<p>"I care very little what the people of Saint-Chartier say," said little Marie. "Take him, Germain, I beg you; I shall be prouder of him than of my wedding-dress."</p>
<p>Germain yielded the point, and the handsome trio dashed forward at Grise's proudest gallop.</p>
<p>And, in fact, the people of Saint-Chartier, although very satirical and a little inclined to be disagreeable in their intercourse with the neighboring parishes which had been combined with theirs, did not think of laughing when they saw such a handsome bridegroom and lovely bride, and a child that a king's wife would have envied. Petit-Pierre had a full coat of blue-bottle colored cloth, and a cunning little red waistcoat so short that it hardly came below his chin. The village tailor had made the sleeves so tight that he could not put his little arms together. And how proud he was! He had a round hat with a black and gold buckle and a peacock's feather protruding jauntily from a tuft of Guinea-hen's feathers. A bunch of flowers larger than his head covered his shoulder, and ribbons floated down to his feet. The hemp-beater, who was also the village barber and wig-maker, had cut his hair in a circle, covering his head with a bowl and cutting off all that protruded, an infallible method of guiding the scissors accurately. Thus accoutred, he was less picturesque, surely, than with his long hair flying in the wind and his lamb's fleece <i>à la</i> Saint John the Baptist; but he had no such idea, and everybody admired him, saying that he looked like a little man. His beauty triumphed over everything, and, in sooth, over what would not the incomparable beauty of childhood triumph?</p>
<p>His little sister Solange had, for the first time in her life, a real cap instead of the little child's cap of Indian muslin that little girls wear up to the age of two or three years. And such a cap! higher and broader than the poor little creature's whole body. And how lovely she considered herself! She dared not turn her head, and sat perfectly straight and stiff, thinking that people would take her for the bride.</p>
<p>As for little Sylvain, he was still in long dresses and lay asleep on his grandmother's knees, with no very clear idea of what a wedding might be.</p>
<p>Germain gazed affectionately at his children, and said to his fiancée, as they arrived at the mayor's office:</p>
<p>"Do you know, Marie, I ride up to this door a little happier than I was the day I brought you home from the woods of Chanteloube, thinking that you would never love me; I took you in my arms to put you on the ground just as I do now, but I didn't think we should ever be together again on good Grise with this child on our knees. I love you so much, you see, I love those dear little ones so much, I am so happy because you love me and love them and because my people love you, and I love my mother and my friends and everybody so much to-day, that I wish I had three or four hearts to hold it all. Really, one is too small to hold so much love and so much happiness! I have something like a pain in my stomach."</p>
<p>There was a crowd at the mayor's door and at the church to see the pretty bride. Why should we not describe her costume? it became her so well. Her cap of white embroidered muslin had flaps trimmed with lace. In those days, peasant-women did not allow themselves to show a single hair; and although their caps conceal magnificent masses of hair rolled in bands of white thread to keep the head-dress in place, even in these days it would be considered an immodest and shameful action to appear before men bareheaded. They do allow themselves now, however, to wear a narrow band across the forehead, which improves their appearance very much. But I regret the classic head-dress of my time: the white lace against the skin had a suggestion of old fashioned chastity which seemed to me more solemn, and when a face was beautiful under those circumstances, it was a beauty whose artless charm and majesty no words can describe.</p>
<p>Little Marie still wore that head dress, and her forehead was so white and so pure that it defied the white of the linen to cast a shadow upon it. Although she had not closed her eyes during the night, the morning air, and above all things the inward joy of a soul as spotless as the sky, and a little hidden fire, held in check by the modesty of youth, sent to her cheeks a flush as delicate as the peach-blossom in the early days of April.</p>
<p>Her white fichu, chastely crossed over her bosom, showed only the graceful contour of a neck as full and round as a turtle-dove's; her morning dress of fine myrtle-green cloth marked the shape of her slender waist, which seemed perfect, but was likely to grow and develop, for she was only seventeen. She wore an apron of violet silk, with the pinafore which our village women have made a great mistake in abolishing, and which imparted so much modesty and refinement to the chest. To-day, they spread out their fichus more proudly, but there is no longer that sweet flower of old-fashioned pudicity in their costume that made them resemble Holbein's virgins. They are more coquettish, more graceful. The correct style in the old days was a sort of unbending stiffness which made their infrequent smiles more profound and more ideal.</p>
<p>At the offertory, Germain, according to the usual custom, placed the <i>treizain</i>—that is to say, thirteen pieces of silver—in his fiancée's hand. He placed on her finger a silver ring of a shape that remained invariable for centuries, but has since been replaced by the <i>band of gold.</i> As they left the church, Marie whispered: "Is it the ring I wanted? the one I asked you for, Germain?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he replied, "the one my Catherine had on her finger when she died. The same ring for both my marriages."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Germain," said the young wife in a serious tone and with deep feeling. "I shall die with it, and if I die before you, you must keep it for your little Solange."</p>

<h2>THE CABBAGE</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>They remounted their horses, and rode rapidly back to Belair. The banquet was a sumptuous affair, and lasted, intermingled with dancing and singing, until midnight. The old people did not leave the table for fourteen hours. The grave-digger did the cooking, and did it very well. He was renowned for that, and he left his ovens to come and dance and sing between every two courses. And yet he was epileptic, was poor Père Bontemps. Who would have suspected it? He was as fresh and vigorous and gay as a young man. One day we found him lying like a dead man in a ditch, all distorted by his malady, just at nightfall. We carried him to our house in a wheelbarrow, and passed the night taking care of him. Three days later, he was at a wedding, singing like a thrush, leaping like a kid, and frisking about in the old-fashioned way. On leaving a marriage-feast, he would go and dig a grave and nail up a coffin. He performed those duties devoutly, and although they seemed to have no effect on his merry humor, he retained a melancholy impression which hastened the return of his attacks. His wife, a paralytic, had not left her chair for twenty years. His mother is a hundred and forty years old and is still alive. But he, poor man, so jovial and kind-hearted and amusing, was killed last year by falling from his loft to the pavement. Doubtless he was suddenly attacked by his malady, and had hidden himself in the hay, as he was accustomed to do, in order not to frighten and distress his family. Thus ended, in a tragic way, a life as strange as himself, a mixture of gloom and folly, of horror and hilarity, amid which his heart remained always kind and his character lovable.</p>
<p>But we are coming to the third day of the wedding-feast, which is the most interesting of all, and has been retained in full vigor down to our own day. We will say nothing of the slice of toast that is carried to the nuptial bed; that is an absurd custom which offends the modesty of the bride, and tends to destroy that of the young girls who are present. Moreover, I think that it is a custom which obtains in all the provinces and has no peculiar features as practised among us.</p>
<p class="c2"><a id="img005"/>Chapter IV (Appendix) He fell on his knees in the furrow through which he was about to run his plough once more, and repeated the morning prayer with such emotion that the tears rolled down his cheeks, still moist with perspiration<br/></p>
<h5>Chapter IV (Appendix)</h5>
<h5 class="c9">He fell on his knees in the furrow through which he was about to run his plough once more, and repeated the morning prayer with such emotion that the tears rolled down his cheeks, still moist with perspiration</h5>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Just as the ceremony of the <i>livrées</i> is the symbol of the taking possession of the bride's heart and home, that of the <i>cabbage</i> is the symbol of the fruitfulness of the union. After breakfast on the day following the marriage-ceremony, comes this strange performance, which is of Gallic origin, but, as it passed through the hands of the primitive Christians, gradually became a sort of <i>mystery</i>, or burlesque morality-play of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Two youths—the merriest and most energetic of the party—disappear during the breakfast, don their costumes, and return, escorted by the musicians, dogs, children, and pistol-shots. They represent a couple of beggars, husband and wife, covered with the vilest rags. The husband is the dirtier of the two: it is vice that has degraded him; the woman is unhappy simply and debased by her husband's evil ways.</p>
<p>They are called the <i>gardener</i> and the <i>gardener's wife</i>, and claim to be fitted to watch and cultivate the sacred cabbage. But the husband is known by several appellations, all of which have a meaning. He is called, indifferently, the <i>pailloux</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7_7"/><a href="3626861088260803644_12816-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_7_7" class="pginternal"><sup>[7]</sup></a> because he wears a wig made of straw or hemp, and, to hide his nakedness, which is ill protected by his rags, he surrounds his legs and a part of his body with straw. He also provides himself with a huge belly or a hump by stuffing straw or hay under his blouse. The <i>peilloux</i> because he is covered with <i>peille</i> (rags). And, lastly, the <i>païen</i> (heathen), which is the most significant of all, because he is supposed, by his cynicism and his debauched life, to represent in himself the antipodes of all the Christian virtues.</p>
<p>He arrives with his face daubed with grease and wine lees, sometimes swallowed up in a grotesque mask. A wretched, cracked earthen cup, or an old wooden shoe, hanging by a string to his belt, he uses to ask alms in the shape of wine. No one refuses him, and he pretends to drink, then pours the wine on the ground by way of libation. At every step, he falls and rolls in the mud; he pretends to be most disgustingly drunk. His poor wife runs after him, picks him up, calls for help, tears out the hempen hair that protrudes in stringy locks from beneath her soiled cap, weeps over her husband's degradation, and reproaches him pathetically.</p>
<p>"You wretch!" she says, "see what your bad conduct has reduced us to! It's no use for me to spin, to work for you, to mend your clothes! you never stop tearing and soiling them. You have run through my little property, our six children are in the gutter, we live in a stable with the beasts; here we are reduced to asking alms, and you're so ugly, so revolting, so despised, that soon they will toss bread to us as they do to the dogs. Alas! my poor <i>mondes</i> [people], take pity on us! take pity on me! I don't deserve my fate, and no woman ever had a filthier, more detestable husband. Help me to pick him up, or else the wagons will crush him like an old broken bottle, and I shall be a widow, which would kill me with grief, although everybody says it would be great good fortune for me."</p>
<p>Such is the rôle of the gardener's wife and her constant lamentation throughout the play. For it is a genuine, spontaneous, improvised comedy, played in the open air, on the highways, among the fields, seasoned by all the incidents that happen to occur; and in it everybody takes a part, wedding-guests and outsiders, occupants of the houses and passers-by, for three or four hours in the day, as we shall see. The theme is always the same, but it is treated in an infinite variety of ways, and therein we see the instinct of mimicry, the abundance of grotesque ideas, the fluency, the quickness at repartee, and even the natural eloquence of our peasants.</p>
<p>The part of the gardener's wife is ordinarily entrusted to a slender, beardless man with a fresh complexion, who is able to give great verisimilitude to the character he assumes and to represent burlesque despair so naturally that the spectators may be amused and saddened at the same time as by the genuine article. Such thin, beardless men are not rare in our country districts, and, strangely enough, they are sometimes the most remarkable for muscular strength.</p>
<p>After the wife's wretched plight is made evident, the younger wedding-guests urge her to leave her sot of a husband and divert herself with them. They offer her their arms and lead her away. Gradually she yields, becomes animated, and runs about, now with one, now with another, behaving in a scandalous way: a new moral lesson—the husband's misconduct incites and causes misconduct on the part of his wife.</p>
<p>The <i>païen</i> thereupon awakes from his drunken stupor; he looks about for his companion, provides himself with a rope and a stick, and runs after her. They lead him a long chase, they hide from him, they pass the woman from one to another, they try to keep her amused, and to deceive her jealous mate. His <i>friends</i> try hard to intoxicate him. At last, he overtakes his faithless spouse and attempts to beat her. The most realistic, shrewdest touch in this parody of the miseries of conjugal life, is that the jealous husband never attacks those who take his wife away from him. He is very polite and prudent with them, he does not choose to vent his wrath on any one but the guilty wife, because she is supposed to be unable to resist him.</p>
<p>But just as he raises his stick and prepares his rope to bind the culprit, all the men in the wedding-party interpose and throw themselves between the two. <i>Don't strike her! never strike your wife</i>! is the formula that is repeated to satiety in these scenes. They disarm the husband, they force him to pardon his wife and embrace her, and soon he pretends to love her more dearly than ever. He walks about arm-in-arm with her, singing and dancing, until a fresh attack of intoxication sends him headlong to the ground once more: and with that his wife's lamentations recommence, her discouragement, her pretended misconduct, the husband's jealousy, the intervention of the bystanders, and the reconciliation. There is in all this an ingenuous, even commonplace, lesson, which savors strongly of its origin in the Middle Ages, but which always makes an impression, if not upon the bride and groom,—who are too much in love and too sensible to-day to need it,—at all events, upon the children and young girls and boys. The <i>païen</i> so terrifies and disgusts the girls, by running after them and pretending to want to kiss them, that they fly from him with an emotion in which there is nothing artificial. His besmeared face and his great stick—perfectly harmless, by the way—makes the youngsters shriek with fear. It is the comedy of manners in its most elementary but most impressive state.</p>
<p>When this farce is well under way, they prepare to go in search of the cabbage. They bring a hand-barrow, on which the <i>païen</i> is placed, armed with a spade, a rope, and a great basket. Four strong men carry him on their shoulders. His wife follows him on foot, the <i>ancients</i> come in a group behind, with grave and pensive mien; then the wedding-party falls in two by two, keeping time to the music. The pistol-shots begin again, the dogs howl louder than ever at sight of the unclean <i>païen</i>, thus borne in triumph. The children salute him derisively with wooden clogs tied at the ends of strings.</p>
<p>But why this ovation to such a revolting personage? They are marching to the conquest of the sacred cabbage, the emblem of matrimonial fecundity, and this besotted drunkard is the only man who can put his hand upon the symbolical plant. Therein, doubtless, is a mystery anterior to Christianity, a mystery that reminds one of the festival of the Saturnalia or some ancient Bacchanalian revel. Perhaps this <i>païen</i>, who is at the same time the gardener <i>par excellence</i>, is nothing less than Priapus in person, the god of gardens and debauchery,—a divinity probably chaste and serious in his origin, however, like the mystery of reproduction, but insensibly degraded by licentiousness of manners and disordered ideas.</p>
<p>However that may be, the triumphal procession arrives at the bride's house and marches into her garden. There they select the finest cabbage, which is not quickly done, for the ancients hold a council and discuss the matter at interminable length, each pleading for the cabbage which seems to him the best adapted for the occasion. The question is put to a vote, and when the choice is made, the <i>gardener</i> fastens his rope around the stalk and goes as far away as the size of the garden permits. The gardener's wife looks out to see that the sacred vegetable is not injured in its fall. The <i>Jesters</i> of the wedding-party, the hemp-beater, the grave-digger, the carpenter, or the cobbler,—in a word, all those who do not work on the land, and who, as they pass their lives in other people's houses, are reputed to have and do really have more wit and a readier tongue than the simple agricultural laborers,—take their places around the cabbage. One digs a trench with the spade, so deep that you would say he was preparing to dig up an oak-tree. Another puts on his nose a <i>drogue</i>, made of wood or pasteboard, in imitation of a pair of spectacles: he performs the duties of <i>engineer</i>, comes forward, walks away, prepares a plan, overlooks the workmen, draws lines, plays the pedant, cries out that they are spoiling the whole thing, orders the work to be abandoned and resumed according to his fancy, and makes the performance as long and as absurd as he can. Is this an addition to the former programme of the ceremony, in mockery of theorists in general, for whom the ordinary peasant has the most sovereign contempt, or in detestation of land-surveyors, who control the register of lands and assess the taxes, or of the employees of the Department of Roads and Bridges, who convert common lands into highways and cause the suppression of time-worn abuses dear to the peasant heart? Certain it is that this character in the comedy is called the <i>geometrician</i>, and that he does his utmost to make himself unbearable to those who handle the pick and shovel.</p>
<p>At last, after quarter of an hour of mummery and remonstrances, so that the roots of the cabbage may not be cut and it can be transplanted without injury, while spadefuls of earth are thrown into the faces of the bystanders,—woe to him who does not step aside quickly enough; though he were a bishop or a prince, he must receive the baptism of earth,—the <i>païen</i> pulls the rope, the <i>païenne</i> holds her apron, and the cabbage falls majestically amid the cheers of the spectators. Then the basket is brought, and the pagan couple proceed to plant the cabbage therein with all imaginable care and precautions. They pack it in fresh soil, they prop it up with sticks and strings as city florists do their superb potted camellias; they plant red apples stuck on twigs, branches of thyme, sage, and laurel all about it; they deck the whole with ribbons and streamers; they place the trophy on the hand-barrow with the <i>paten</i>, who is expected to maintain its equilibrium and keep it from accident, and at last they leave the garden in good order to the music of a march.</p>
<p>But when they come to pass through the gate, and again when they try to enter the bridegroom's yard, an imaginary obstacle bars the passage. The bearers of the barrow stumble, utter loud exclamations, step back, go forward again, and, as if they were driven back by an invisible force, seem to succumb under the burden. Meanwhile, the rest of the party laugh heartily and urge on and soothe the human team. "Softly! softly, boy! Come, courage! Look out! Patience! Stoop! The gate is too low! Close up, it's too narrow! a little to the left; now to the right! Come, take heart, there you are!"</p>
<p>So it sometimes happens that, in years of abundant crops, the ox-cart, laden beyond measure with fodder or grain, is too broad or too high to enter the barndoor. And such exclamations are shouted at the powerful cattle to restrain or excite them; and with skilful handling and vigorous efforts the mountain of wealth is made to pass, without mishap, beneath the rustic triumphal arch. Especially with the last load, called the <i>gerbaude</i>, are these precautions required; for that is made the occasion of a rustic festival, and the last sheaf gathered from the last furrow is placed on top of the load, decorated with ribbons and flowers, as are the heads of the oxen and the driver's goad. Thus the triumphal, laborious entry of the cabbage into the house is an emblem of the prosperity and fruitfulness it represents.</p>
<p>Arrived in the bridegroom's yard, the cabbage is taken to the highest point of the house or the barn. If there is a chimney, a gable end, a dove-cote higher than the other elevated portions, the burden must, at any risk, be taken to that culminating point. The <i>païen</i> accompanies it thither, fixes it in place, and waters it from a huge jug of wine, while a salvo of pistol-shots and the joyful contortions of the <i>païenne</i> announce its inauguration.</p>
<p>The same ceremony is immediately repeated. Another cabbage is dug up in the bridegroom's garden and borne with the same formalities to the roof that his wife has abandoned to go with him. The trophies remain in place until the rain and wind destroy the baskets and carry off the cabbages. But they live long enough to offer some chance of fulfilment of the prophecy that the old men and matrons utter as they salute them. "Beautiful cabbage," they say, "live and flourish, so that our young bride may have a fine little baby before the end of the year; for if you die too quickly, it will be a sign of sterility, and you will be stuck up there on top of the house like an evil omen."</p>
<p>The day is far advanced before all these performances are at an end. It only remains to escort the husband and wife to the godfathers and godmothers. When these putative parents live at a distance, they are escorted by the musicians and all the wedding-party to the limits of the parish. There, there is more dancing by the roadside, and they kiss the bride and groom when they take leave of them. The <i>païen</i> and his wife are then washed and dressed in clean clothes, when they are not so fatigued by their rôles that they have had to take a nap.</p>
<p>They were still dancing and singing and eating at the farm-house at Belair at midnight on the third day of the festivities attending Germain's wedding. The old men were seated at the table, unable to leave it, and for good reason. They did not recover their legs and their wits until the next day at dawn. At that time, while they sought their homes, in silence and with uncertain steps, Germain, proud and well-content, went out to yoke his cattle, leaving his young wife to sleep until sunrise. The lark, singing as he flew upward to the sky, seemed to him to be the voice of his heart, giving thanks to Providence. The hoar-frost, glistening on the bare bushes, seemed to him the white April blossoms that precede the appearance of the leaves. All nature was serene and smiling in his eyes. Little Pierre had laughed and jumped about so much the day before, that he did not come to help him to drive his oxen; but Germain was content to be alone. He fell on his knees in the furrow through which he was about to run his plough once more, and repeated the morning prayer with such emotion that the tears rolled down his cheeks, still moist with perspiration.</p>
<p>In the distance could be heard the songs of the youths from the adjoining parishes, just starting for home, and repeating, in voices somewhat the worse for wear, the merry refrains of the preceding night.</p>

<br/>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

<br/>set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
<br/>copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
<br/>protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

<br/>charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

<br/>rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
<br/>such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

<br/>*** START: FULL LICENSE ***
<br/>
<br/>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
<br/>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
<br/>
<br/>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
<br/>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
<br/>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<br/>https://gutenberg.org/license).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic works
<br/>
<br/>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
<br/>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
<br/>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
<br/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
<br/>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
<br/>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
<br/>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
<br/>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
<br/>
<br/>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
<br/>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
<br/>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
<br/>
<br/>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
<br/>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
<br/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
<br/>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
<br/>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
<br/>
<br/>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
<br/>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
<br/>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
<br/>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
<br/>States.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
<br/>
<br/>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
<br/>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
<br/>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
<br/>phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
<br/>copied or distributed:
<br/>
<br/>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
<br/>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
<br/>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
<br/>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
<br/>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
<br/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
<br/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
<br/>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
<br/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
<br/>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
<br/>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
<br/>1.E.9.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
<br/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
<br/>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
<br/>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
<br/>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
<br/>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
<br/>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
<br/>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
<br/>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
<br/>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
<br/>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
<br/>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
<br/>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
<br/>"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
<br/>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
<br/>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
<br/>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
<br/>request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
<br/>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
<br/>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
<br/>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
<br/>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
<br/>that
<br/>
<br/>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
<br/>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
<br/>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
<br/>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
<br/>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
<br/>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
<br/>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
<br/>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
<br/>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
<br/>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
<br/>     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
<br/>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
<br/>
<br/>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
<br/>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
<br/>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>     License.  You must require such a user to return or
<br/>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
<br/>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
<br/>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
<br/>
<br/>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
<br/>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
<br/>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
<br/>     of receipt of the work.
<br/>
<br/>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
<br/>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
<br/>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
<br/>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
<br/>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
<br/>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<br/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
<br/>your equipment.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
<br/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
<br/>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
<br/>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
<br/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
<br/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
<br/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
<br/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
<br/>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br/>DAMAGE.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
<br/>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
<br/>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
<br/>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
<br/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
<br/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
<br/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
<br/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
<br/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
<br/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
<br/>opportunities to fix the problem.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
<br/>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
<br/>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
<br/>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
<br/>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
<br/>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
<br/>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
<br/>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
<br/>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
<br/>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
<br/>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
<br/>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
<br/>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
<br/>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
<br/>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<br/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<br/>people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<br/>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
<br/>and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
<br/>Foundation
<br/>
<br/>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
<br/>501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
<br/>state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
<br/>Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
<br/>number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
<br/>https://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
<br/>permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
<br/>Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
<br/>throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at
<br/>809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<br/>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<br/>particular state visit https://pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
<br/>donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<br/>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<br/>
<br/>     https://www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
