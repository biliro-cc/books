<h3 id="pgepubid00061">CANDIDE'S VOYAGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE.</h3>
<p>The faithful Cacambo had already prevailed upon the Turkish skipper, who was to conduct the Sultan Achmet to Constantinople, to receive Candide and Martin on his ship. They both embarked after having made their obeisance to his miserable Highness.</p>
<p>"You see," said Candide to Martin on the way, "we supped with six dethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom I gave charity. Perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate. For my part, I have only lost a hundred sheep; and now I am flying into Cunegonde's arms. My dear Martin, yet once more Pangloss was right: all is for the best."</p>
<p>"I wish it," answered Martin.</p>
<p>"But," said Candide, "it was a very strange adventure we met with at Venice. It has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings have supped together at a public inn."</p>
<p>"It is not more extraordinary," said Martin, "than most of the things that have happened to us. It is a very common thing for kings to be<a id="Page_149" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 149]"></a> dethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their company, it is a trifle not worth our attention."</p>
<p>No sooner had Candide got on board the vessel than he flew to his old valet and friend Cacambo, and tenderly embraced him.</p>
<p>"Well," said he, "what news of Cunegonde? Is she still a prodigy of beauty? Does she love me still? How is she? Thou hast doubtless bought her a palace at Constantinople?"</p>
<p>"My dear master," answered Cacambo, "Cunegonde washes dishes on the banks of the Propontis, in the service of a prince, who has very few dishes to wash; she is a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign named Ragotsky,<a id="FNanchor_35_35"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor pginternal">[35]</a> to whom the Grand Turk allows three crowns a day in his exile. But what is worse still is, that she has lost her beauty and has become horribly ugly."</p>
<p>"Well, handsome or ugly," replied Candide, "I am a man of honour, and it is my duty to love her still. But how came she to be reduced to so abject a state with the five or six millions that you took to her?"</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Cacambo, "was I not to give two millions to Senor Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza, Governor of Buenos Ayres, for permitting Miss Cunegonde to come away? And did<a id="Page_150" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 150]"></a> not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest? Did not this corsair carry us to Cape Matapan, to Milo, to Nicaria, to Samos, to Petra, to the Dardanelles, to Marmora, to Scutari? Cunegonde and the old woman serve the prince I now mentioned to you, and I am slave to the dethroned Sultan."</p>
<p>"What a series of shocking calamities!" cried Candide. "But after all, I have some diamonds left; and I may easily pay Cunegonde's ransom. Yet it is a pity that she is grown so ugly."</p>
<p>Then, turning towards Martin: "Who do you think," said he, "is most to be pitiedâ€”the Sultan Achmet, the Emperor Ivan, King Charles Edward, or I?"</p>
<p>"How should I know!" answered Martin. "I must see into your hearts to be able to tell."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Candide, "if Pangloss were here, he could tell."</p>
<p>"I know not," said Martin, "in what sort of scales your Pangloss would weigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their sorrows. All that I can presume to say is, that there are millions of people upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than King Charles Edward, the Emperor Ivan, or the Sultan Achmet."</p>
<p>"That may well be," said Candide.</p>
<p>In a few days they reached the Bosphorus,<a id="Page_151" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 151]"></a> and Candide began by paying a very high ransom for Cacambo. Then without losing time, he and his companions went on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of the Propontis for his Cunegonde, however ugly she might have become.</p>
<p>Among the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose bare shoulders the Levantine captain would now and then apply blows from a bull's pizzle. Candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two slaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them with pity. Their features though greatly disfigured, had a slight resemblance to those of Pangloss and the unhappy Jesuit and Westphalian Baron, brother to Miss Cunegonde. This moved and saddened him. He looked at them still more attentively.</p>
<p>"Indeed," said he to Cacambo, "if I had not seen Master Pangloss hanged, and if I had not had the misfortune to kill the Baron, I should think it was they that were rowing."</p>
<p>At the names of the Baron and of Pangloss, the two galley-slaves uttered a loud cry, held fast by the seat, and let drop their oars. The captain ran up to them and redoubled his blows with the bull's pizzle.</p>
<p>"Stop! stop! sir," cried Candide. "I will give you what money you please."<a id="Page_152" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 152]"></a></p>
<p>"What! it is Candide!" said one of the slaves.</p>
<p>"What! it is Candide!" said the other.</p>
<p>"Do I dream?" cried Candide; "am I awake? or am I on board a galley? Is this the Baron whom I killed? Is this Master Pangloss whom I saw hanged?"</p>
<p>"It is we! it is we!" answered they.</p>
<p>"Well! is this the great philosopher?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"Ah! captain," said Candide, "what ransom will you take for Monsieur de Thunder-ten-Tronckh, one of the first barons of the empire, and for Monsieur Pangloss, the profoundest metaphysician in Germany?"</p>
<p>"Dog of a Christian," answered the Levantine captain, "since these two dogs of Christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which I doubt not are high dignities in their country, you shall give me fifty thousand sequins."</p>
<p>"You shall have them, sir. Carry me back at once to Constantinople, and you shall receive the money directly. But no; carry me first to Miss Cunegonde."</p>
<p>Upon the first proposal made by Candide, however, the Levantine captain had already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than a bird cleaves the air.</p>
<p>Candide embraced the Baron and Pangloss a hundred times.</p>
<p>"And how happened it, my dear Baron, that<a id="Page_153" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 153]"></a> I did not kill you? And, my dear Pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? And why are you both in a Turkish galley?"</p>
<p>"And it is true that my dear sister is in this country?" said the Baron.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Cacambo.</p>
<p>"Then I behold, once more, my dear Candide," cried Pangloss.</p>
<p>Candide presented Martin and Cacambo to them; they embraced each other, and all spoke at once. The galley flew; they were already in the port. Instantly Candide sent for a Jew, to whom he sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to him by Abraham that he could give him no more. He immediately paid the ransom for the Baron and Pangloss. The latter threw himself at the feet of his deliverer, and bathed them with his tears; the former thanked him with a nod, and promised to return him the money on the first opportunity.</p>
<p>"But is it indeed possible that my sister can be in Turkey?" said he.</p>
<p>"Nothing is more possible," said Cacambo, "since she scours the dishes in the service of a Transylvanian prince."</p>
<p>Candide sent directly for two Jews and sold them some more diamonds, and then they all set out together in another galley to deliver Cunegonde from slavery.<a id="Page_154" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 154]"></a></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00062">XXVIII</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00063">WHAT HAPPENED TO CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE, PANGLOSS, MARTIN, ETC.</h3>
<p>"I ask your pardon once more," said Candide to the Baron, "your pardon, reverend father, for having run you through the body."</p>
<p>"Say no more about it," answered the Baron. "I was a little too hasty, I own, but since you wish to know by what fatality I came to be a galley-slave I will inform you. After I had been cured by the surgeon of the college of the wound you gave me, I was attacked and carried off by a party of Spanish troops, who confined me in prison at Buenos Ayres at the very time my sister was setting out thence. I asked leave to return to Rome to the General of my Order. I was appointed chaplain to the French Ambassador at Constantinople. I had not been eight days in this employment when one evening I met with a young Ichoglan, who was a very handsome fellow. The weather was warm. The young man wanted to bathe, and I took this opportunity of bathing also. I did not know that it was a capital crime for a Christian to<a id="Page_155" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 155]"></a> be found naked with a young Mussulman. A cadi ordered me a hundred blows on the soles of the feet, and condemned me to the galleys. I do not think there ever was a greater act of injustice. But I should be glad to know how my sister came to be scullion to a Transylvanian prince who has taken shelter among the Turks."</p>
<p>"But you, my dear Pangloss," said Candide, "how can it be that I behold you again?"</p>
<p>"It is true," said Pangloss, "that you saw me hanged. I should have been burnt, but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were going to roast me; the storm was so violent that they despaired of lighting the fire, so I was hanged because they could do no better. A surgeon purchased my body, carried me home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back, and imagining that he had been dissecting the devil he ran away, dying with fear, and fell down the staircase<a id="Page_156" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 156]"></a> in his flight. His wife, hearing the noise, flew from the next room. She saw me stretched out upon the table with my crucial incision. She was seized with yet greater fear than her husband, fled, and tumbled over him. When they came to themselves a little, I heard the wife say to her husband: 'My dear, how could you take it into your head to dissect a heretic? Do you not know that these people always have the devil in their bodies? I will go and fetch a priest this minute to exorcise him.' At this proposal I shuddered, and mustering up what little courage I had still remaining I cried out aloud, 'Have mercy on me!' At length the Portuguese barber plucked up his spirits. He sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days. The barber found me a place as lackey to a knight of Malta who was going to Venice, but finding that my master had no money to pay me my wages I entered the service of a Venetian merchant, and went with him to Constantinople. One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters. Her bosom was uncovered, and between her breasts she had a beautiful bouquet of tulips, roses, anemones, ranunculus, hyacinths, and auriculas. She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and<a id="Page_157" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 157]"></a> presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I, and I insisted that it was far more innocent to take up a bouquet and place it again on a woman's bosom than to be found stark naked with an Ichoglan. We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us."</p>
<p>"Well, my dear Pangloss," said Candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"</p>
<p>"I am still of my first opinion," answered Pangloss, "for I am a philosopher and I cannot<a id="Page_158" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 158]"></a> retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his <i>plenum</i> and <i>materia subtilis</i>."<a id="Page_159" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 159]"></a></p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<h2 id="pgepubid00064">XXIX</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00065">HOW CANDIDE FOUND CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN AGAIN.</h3>
<p>While Candide, the Baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo were relating their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes, on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the consolations a slave may feel even on a Turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the Transylvanian prince on the banks of the Propontis. The first objects which met their sight were Cunegonde and the old woman hanging towels out to dry.</p>
<p>The Baron paled at this sight. The tender, loving Candide, seeing his beautiful Cunegonde embrowned, with blood-shot eyes, withered neck, wrinkled cheeks, and rough, red arms, recoiled three paces, seized with horror, and then advanced out of good manners. She embraced Candide and her brother; they embraced the old woman, and Candide ransomed them both.</p>
<p>There was a small farm in the neighbourhood<a id="Page_160" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 160]"></a> which the old woman proposed to Candide to make a shift with till the company could be provided for in a better manner. Cunegonde did not know she had grown ugly, for nobody had told her of it; and she reminded Candide of his promise in so positive a tone that the good man durst not refuse her. He therefore intimated to the Baron that he intended marrying his sister.</p>
<p>"I will not suffer," said the Baron, "such meanness on her part, and such insolence on yours; I will never be reproached with this scandalous thing; my sister's children would never be able to enter the church in Germany. No; my sister shall only marry a baron of the empire."</p>
<p>Cunegonde flung herself at his feet, and bathed them with her tears; still he was inflexible.</p>
<p>"Thou foolish fellow," said Candide; "I have delivered thee out of the galleys, I have paid thy ransom, and thy sister's also; she was a scullion, and is very ugly, yet I am so condescending as to marry her; and dost thou pretend to oppose the match? I should kill thee again, were I only to consult my anger."</p>
<p>"Thou mayest kill me again," said the Baron, "but thou shalt not marry my sister, at least whilst I am living."<a id="Page_161" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 161]"></a></p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<h2 id="pgepubid00066">XXX</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00067">THE CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p>At the bottom of his heart Candide had no wish to marry Cunegonde. But the extreme impertinence of the Baron determined him to conclude the match, and Cunegonde pressed him so strongly that he could not go from his word. He consulted Pangloss, Martin, and the faithful Cacambo. Pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the Baron had no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the empire, she might marry Candide with her left hand. Martin was for throwing the Baron into the sea; Cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they thought to send him back to the General Father of the Order at Rome by the first ship. This advice was well received, the old woman approved it; they said not a word to his sister; the thing was executed for a little money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a Jesuit, and punishing the pride of a German baron.<a id="Page_162" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 162]"></a></p>
<p>It is natural to imagine that after so many disasters Candide married, and living with the philosopher Pangloss, the philosopher Martin, the prudent Cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient Incas, must have led a very happy life. But he was so much imposed upon by the Jews that he had nothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day, more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than Cunegonde. Cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took vegetables for sale to Constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and cursed his destiny. Pangloss was in despair at not shining in some German university. For Martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be as badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. Candide, Martin, and Pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics. They often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of Effendis, Pashas, and Cadis, who were going into banishment to Lemnos, Mitylene, or Erzeroum. And they saw other Cadis, Pashas, and Effendis coming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their turn. They saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the Sublime Porte. Such spectacles as these increased the number<a id="Page_163" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 163]"></a> of their dissertations; and when they did not dispute time hung so heavily upon their hands, that one day the old woman ventured to say to them:</p>
<p>"I want to know which is worse, to be ravished a hundred times by negro pirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the Bulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an <i>auto-da-fÃ©</i>, to be dissected, to row in the galleysâ€”in short, to go through all the miseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?"</p>
<p>"It is a great question," said Candide.</p>
<p>This discourse gave rise to new reflections, and Martin especially concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting inquietude or of lethargic disgust. Candide did not quite agree to that, but he affirmed nothing. Pangloss owned that he had always suffered horribly, but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well, he asserted it still, though he no longer believed it.</p>
<p>What helped to confirm Martin in his detestable principles, to stagger Candide more than ever, and to puzzle Pangloss, was that one day they saw Paquette and Friar GiroflÃ©e land at the farm in extreme misery. They had soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were reconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown<a id="Page_164" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 164]"></a> into gaol, had escaped, and Friar GiroflÃ©e had at length become Turk. Paquette continued her trade wherever she went, but made nothing of it.</p>
<p>"I foresaw," said Martin to Candide, "that your presents would soon be dissipated, and only make them the more miserable. You have rolled in millions of money, you and Cacambo; and yet you are not happier than Friar GiroflÃ©e and Paquette."</p>
<p>"Ha!" said Pangloss to Paquette, "Providence has then brought you amongst us again, my poor child! Do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? What a world is this!"</p>
<p>And now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood there lived a very famous Dervish who was esteemed the best philosopher in all Turkey, and they went to consult him. Pangloss was the speaker.</p>
<p>"Master," said he, "we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal as man was made."</p>
<p>"With what meddlest thou?" said the Dervish; "is it thy business?"</p>
<p>"But, reverend father," said Candide, "there is horrible evil in this world."</p>
<p>"What signifies it," said the Dervish, "whether there be evil or good? When his highness sends<a id="Page_165" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 165]"></a> a ship to Egypt, does he trouble his head whether the mice on board are at their ease or not?"</p>
<p>"What, then, must we do?" said Pangloss.</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue," answered the Dervish.</p>
<p>"I was in hopes," said Pangloss, "that I should reason with you a little about causes and effects, about the best of possible worlds, the origin of evil, the nature of the soul, and the pre-established harmony."</p>
<p>At these words, the Dervish shut the door in their faces.</p>
<p>During this conversation, the news was spread that two Viziers and the Mufti had been strangled at Constantinople, and that several of their friends had been impaled. This catastrophe made a great noise for some hours. Pangloss, Candide, and Martin, returning to the little farm, saw a good old man taking the fresh air at his door under an orange bower. Pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what was the name of the strangled Mufti.</p>
<p>"I do not know," answered the worthy man, "and I have not known the name of any Mufti, nor of any Vizier. I am entirely ignorant of the event you mention; I presume in general that they who meddle with the administration of public affairs die sometimes miserably, and that they deserve it; but I never trouble my head<a id="Page_166" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 166]"></a> about what is transacting at Constantinople; I content myself with sending there for sale the fruits of the garden which I cultivate."</p>
<p>Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they made themselves, with Kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee unadulterated with the bad coffee of Batavia or the American islands. After which the two daughters of the honest Mussulman perfumed the strangers' beards.</p>
<p>"You must have a vast and magnificent estate," said Candide to the Turk.</p>
<p>"I have only twenty acres," replied the old man; "I and my children cultivate them; our labour preserves us from three great evilsâ€”weariness, vice, and want."</p>
<p>Candide, on his way home, made profound reflections on the old man's conversation.</p>
<p>"This honest Turk," said he to Pangloss and Martin, "seems to be in a situation far preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honour of supping."</p>
<p>"Grandeur," said Pangloss, "is extremely dangerous according to the testimony of philosophers. For, in short, Eglon, King of Moab,<a id="Page_167" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 167]"></a> was assassinated by Ehud; Absalom was hung by his hair, and pierced with three darts; King Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, was killed by Baasa; King Ela by Zimri; Ahaziah by Jehu; Athaliah by Jehoiada; the Kings Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, and Zedekiah, were led into captivity. You know how perished CrÅ“sus, Astyages, Darius, Dionysius of Syracuse, Pyrrhus, Perseus, Hannibal, Jugurtha, Ariovistus, CÃ¦sar, Pompey, Nero, Otho, Vitellius, Domitian, Richard II. of England, Edward II., Henry VI., Richard III., Mary Stuart, Charles I., the three Henrys of France, the Emperor Henry IV.! You knowâ€”â€”"</p>
<p>"I know also," said Candide, "that we must cultivate our garden."</p>
<p>"You are right," said Pangloss, "for when man was first placed in the Garden of Eden, he was put there <i>ut operaretur eum</i>, that he might cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle."</p>
<p>"Let us work," said Martin, "without disputing; it is the only way to render life tolerable."</p>
<p>The whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to their different abilities. Their little plot of land produced plentiful crops. Cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent pastry cook; Paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after the<a id="Page_168" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 168]"></a> linen. They were all, not excepting Friar GiroflÃ©e, of some service or other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.</p>
<p>Pangloss sometimes said to Candide:</p>
<p>"There is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds: for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of Miss Cunegonde: if you had not been put into the Inquisition: if you had not walked over America: if you had not stabbed the Baron: if you had not lost all your sheep from the fine country of El Dorado: you would not be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio-nuts."</p>
<p>"All that is very well," answered Candide, "but let us cultivate our garden."<a id="Page_169" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 169]"></a></p>

I drove three great nails through her behind; it is then she would have wept if she had been able.'"â€”Voltaire, <i>MÃ©langes</i>.</p>

But do you not feel the pity and sympathy of the painter? Here irony becomes sad, and in a way an avenger.

<br/>
<br/>1.B.Â  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.Â  It may only be

<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.Â  See
<br/>paragraph 1.C below.Â  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

<br/>works.Â  See paragraph 1.E below.
<br/>
<br/>1.C.Â  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.Â  Nearly all the individual works in the
<br/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.Â  If an
<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
<br/>are removed.Â  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
<br/>the work.Â  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
<br/>
<br/>1.D.Â  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
<br/>what you can do with this work.Â  Copyright laws in most countries are in
<br/>a constant state of change.Â  If you are outside the United States, check
<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.Â  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
<br/>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
<br/>States.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.Â  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
<br/>
<br/>1.E.1.Â  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
<br/>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
<br/>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
<br/>phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
<br/>copied or distributed:
<br/>
<br/>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
<br/>almost no restrictions whatsoever.Â  You may copy it, give it away or
<br/>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
<br/>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>1.E.2.Â  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
<br/>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
<br/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
<br/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
<br/>or charges.Â  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
<br/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

<br/>
<br/>SectionÂ  2.Â  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<br/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.Â  It exists
<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<br/>people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.Â  In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<br/>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
<br/>and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

<br/>
<br/>Section 4.Â  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment.Â  Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States.Â  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements.Â  We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.Â  To
<br/>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<br/>particular state visit http://pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States.Â  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses.Â  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
<br/>To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

<br/>Section 5.Â  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<br/>with anyone.Â  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.Â  Thus, we do not necessarily
<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<br/>
<br/>Â Â Â Â  http://www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
