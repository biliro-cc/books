<h3 id="pgepubid00029">HISTORY OF THE OLD WOMAN.</h3>
<p>"I had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids; neither did my nose always touch my chin; nor was I always a servant. I am the daughter of Pope Urban X,<a id="FNanchor_10_10"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor pginternal">[10]</a> and of the Princess of Palestrina. Until the age of fourteen I was brought up in a palace, to which all the castles of your German barons would scarcely have served for stables; and one of my robes was worth more than all the magnificence of Westphalia. As I grew up I improved in beauty, wit, and every graceful accomplishment, in the midst of pleasures, hopes, and respectful homage. Already I inspired love. My throat was formed, and such a throat! white, firm, and shaped like that of the Venus of Medici; and what eyes! what eyelids! what black eyebrows! such flames darted from my dark pupils that they eclipsed the scintillation of the stars—as I was told by the poets in our part of the world. My waiting women, when dressing and undressing me, used to fall into an ecstasy, whether they viewed me before<a id="Page_43" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 43]"></a> or behind; how glad would the gentlemen have been to perform that office for them!</p>
<p>"I was affianced to the most excellent Prince of Massa Carara. Such a prince! as handsome as myself, sweet-tempered, agreeable, brilliantly witty, and sparkling with love. I loved him as one loves for the first time—with idolatry, with transport. The nuptials were prepared. There was surprising pomp and magnificence; there were <i>fêtes</i>, carousals, continual <i>opera bouffe</i>; and all Italy composed sonnets in my praise, though not one of them was passable. I was just upon the point of reaching the summit of bliss, when an old marchioness who had been mistress to the Prince, my husband, invited him to drink chocolate with her. He died in less than two hours of most terrible convulsions. But this is only a bagatelle. My mother, in despair, and scarcely less afflicted than myself, determined to absent herself for some time from so fatal a place. She had a very fine estate in the neighbourhood of Gaeta. We embarked on board a galley of the country which was gilded like the great altar of St. Peter's at Rome. A Sallee corsair swooped down and boarded us. Our men defended themselves like the Pope's soldiers; they flung themselves upon their knees, and threw down their arms, begging of the corsair an absolution <i>in articulo mortis</i>.<a id="Page_44" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 44]"></a></p>
<p>"Instantly they were stripped as bare as monkeys; my mother, our maids of honour, and myself were all served in the same manner. It is amazing with what expedition those gentry undress people. But what surprised me most was, that they thrust their fingers into the part of our bodies which the generality of women suffer no other instrument but—pipes to enter. It appeared to me a very strange kind of ceremony; but thus one judges of things when one has not seen the world. I afterwards learnt that it was to try whether we had concealed any diamonds. This is the practice established from time immemorial, among civilised nations that scour the seas. I was informed that the very religious Knights of Malta never fail to make this search when they take any Turkish prisoners of either sex. It is a law of nations from which they never deviate.</p>
<p>"I need not tell <i>you</i> how great a hardship it was for a young princess and her mother to be made slaves and carried to Morocco. You may easily imagine all we had to suffer on board the pirate vessel. My mother was still very handsome; our maids of honour, and even our waiting women, had more charms than are to be found in all Africa. As for myself, I was ravishing, was exquisite, grace itself, and I was a virgin! I did not remain so long; this flower,<a id="Page_45" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 45]"></a> which had been reserved for the handsome Prince of Massa Carara, was plucked by the corsair captain. He was an abominable negro, and yet believed that he did me a great deal of honour. Certainly the Princess of Palestrina and myself must have been very strong to go through all that we experienced until our arrival at Morocco. But let us pass on; these are such common things as not to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>"Morocco swam in blood when we arrived. Fifty sons of the Emperor Muley-Ismael<a id="FNanchor_11_11"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor pginternal">[11]</a> had each their adherents; this produced fifty civil wars, of blacks against blacks, and blacks against tawnies, and tawnies against tawnies, and mulattoes against mulattoes. In short it was a continual carnage throughout the empire.</p>
<p>"No sooner were we landed, than the blacks of a contrary faction to that of my captain attempted to rob him of his booty. Next to jewels and gold we were the most valuable things he had. I was witness to such a battle as you have never seen in your European climates. The northern nations have not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so common in Africa. It seems that you Europeans have only milk in your veins; but it is vitriol, it is fire which runs in those of the inhabitants of Mount Atlas and the neighbouring countries. They fought with the fury of the lions, tigers,<a id="Page_46" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 46]"></a> and serpents of the country, to see who should have us. A Moor seized my mother by the right arm, while my captain's lieutenant held her by the left; a Moorish soldier had hold of her by one leg, and one of our corsairs held her by the other. Thus almost all our women were drawn in quarters by four men. My captain concealed me behind him; and with his drawn scimitar cut and slashed every one that opposed his fury. At length I saw all our Italian women, and my mother herself, torn, mangled, massacred, by the monsters who disputed over them. The slaves, my companions, those who had taken them, soldiers, sailors, blacks, whites, mulattoes, and at last my captain, all were killed, and I remained dying on a heap of dead. Such scenes as this were transacted through an extent of three hundred leagues—and yet they never missed the five prayers a day ordained by Mahomet.</p>
<p>"With difficulty I disengaged myself from such a heap of slaughtered bodies, and crawled to a large orange tree on the bank of a neighbouring rivulet, where I fell, oppressed with fright, fatigue, horror, despair, and hunger. Immediately after, my senses, overpowered, gave themselves up to sleep, which was yet more swooning than repose. I was in this state of weakness and insensibility, between life and<a id="Page_47" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 47]"></a> death, when I felt myself pressed by something that moved upon my body. I opened my eyes, and saw a white man, of good countenance, who sighed, and who said between his teeth: '<i>O che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni!</i>'"<a id="FNanchor_12_12"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor pginternal">[12]</a><a id="Page_48" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 48]"></a></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00030">XII</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00031">THE ADVENTURES OF THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED.</h3>
<p>"Astonished and delighted to hear my native language, and no less surprised at what this man said, I made answer that there were much greater misfortunes than that of which he complained. I told him in a few words of the horrors which I had endured, and fainted a second time. He carried me to a neighbouring house, put me to bed, gave me food, waited upon me, consoled me, flattered me; he told me that he had never seen any one so beautiful as I, and that he never so much regretted the loss of what it was impossible to recover.</p>
<p>"'I was born at Naples,' said he, 'there they geld two or three thousand children every year; some die of the operation, others acquire a voice more beautiful than that of women, and others are raised to offices of state.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor pginternal">[13]</a> This operation was performed on me with great success and I was chapel musician to madam, the Princess of Palestrina.'</p>
<p>"'To my mother!' cried I.</p>
<p>"'Your mother!' cried he, weeping. 'What!<a id="Page_49" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 49]"></a> can you be that young princess whom I brought up until the age of six years, and who promised so early to be as beautiful as you?'</p>
<p>"'It is I, indeed; but my mother lies four hundred yards hence, torn in quarters, under a heap of dead bodies.'</p>
<p>"I told him all my adventures, and he made me acquainted with his; telling me that he had been sent to the Emperor of Morocco by a Christian power, to conclude a treaty with that prince, in consequence of which he was to be furnished with military stores and ships to help to demolish the commerce of other Christian Governments.</p>
<p>"'My mission is done,' said this honest eunuch; 'I go to embark for Ceuta, and will take you to Italy. <i>Ma che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni!</i>'</p>
<p>"I thanked him with tears of commiseration; and instead of taking me to Italy he conducted me to Algiers, where he sold me to the Dey. Scarcely was I sold, than the plague which had made the tour of Africa, Asia, and Europe, broke out with great malignancy in Algiers. You have seen earthquakes; but pray, miss, have you ever had the plague?"</p>
<p>"Never," answered Cunegonde.</p>
<p>"If you had," said the old woman, "you would acknowledge that it is far more terrible<a id="Page_50" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 50]"></a> than an earthquake. It is common in Africa, and I caught it. Imagine to yourself the distressed situation of the daughter of a Pope, only fifteen years old, who, in less than three months, had felt the miseries of poverty and slavery, had been ravished almost every day, had beheld her mother drawn in quarters, had experienced famine and war, and was dying of the plague in Algiers. I did not die, however, but my eunuch, and the Dey, and almost the whole seraglio of Algiers perished.</p>
<p>"As soon as the first fury of this terrible pestilence was over, a sale was made of the Dey's slaves; I was purchased by a merchant, and carried to Tunis; this man sold me to another merchant, who sold me again to another at Tripoli; from Tripoli I was sold to Alexandria, from Alexandria to Smyrna, and from Smyrna to Constantinople. At length I became the property of an Aga of the Janissaries, who was soon ordered away to the defence of Azof, then besieged by the Russians.</p>
<p>"The Aga, who was a very gallant man, took his whole seraglio with him, and lodged us in a small fort on the Palus Méotides, guarded by two black eunuchs and twenty soldiers. The Turks killed prodigious numbers of the Russians, but the latter had their revenge. Azof was destroyed by fire, the inhabitants put to<a id="Page_51" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 51]"></a> the sword, neither sex nor age was spared; until there remained only our little fort, and the enemy wanted to starve us out. The twenty Janissaries had sworn they would never surrender. The extremities of famine to which they were reduced, obliged them to eat our two eunuchs, for fear of violating their oath. And at the end of a few days they resolved also to devour the women.</p>
<p>"We had a very pious and humane Iman, who preached an excellent sermon, exhorting them not to kill us all at once.</p>
<p>"'Only cut off a buttock of each of those ladies,' said he, 'and you'll fare extremely well; if you must go to it again, there will be the same entertainment a few days hence; heaven will accept of so charitable an action, and send you relief.'</p>
<p>"He had great eloquence; he persuaded them; we underwent this terrible operation. The Iman applied the same balsam to us, as he does to children after circumcision; and we all nearly died.</p>
<p>"Scarcely had the Janissaries finished the repast with which we had furnished them, than the Russians came in flat-bottomed boats; not a Janissary escaped. The Russians paid no attention to the condition we were in. There are French surgeons in all parts of the world; one<a id="Page_52" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 52]"></a> of them who was very clever took us under his care—he cured us; and as long as I live I shall remember that as soon as my wounds were healed he made proposals to me. He bid us all be of good cheer, telling us that the like had happened in many sieges, and that it was according to the laws of war.</p>
<p>"As soon as my companions could walk, they were obliged to set out for Moscow. I fell to the share of a Boyard who made me his gardener, and gave me twenty lashes a day. But this nobleman having in two years' time been broke upon the wheel along with thirty more Boyards for some broils at court, I profited by that event; I fled. I traversed all Russia; I was a long time an inn-holder's servant at Riga, the same at Rostock, at Vismar, at Leipzig, at Cassel, at Utrecht, at Leyden, at the Hague, at Rotterdam. I waxed old in misery and disgrace, having only one-half of my posteriors, and always remembering I was a Pope's daughter. A hundred times I was upon the point of killing myself; but still I loved life. This ridiculous foible is perhaps one of our most fatal characteristics; for is there anything more absurd than to wish to carry continually a burden which one can always throw down? to detest existence and yet to cling to one's existence? in brief, to caress<a id="Page_53" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 53]"></a> the serpent which devours us, till he has eaten our very heart?</p>
<p>"In the different countries which it has been my lot to traverse, and the numerous inns where I have been servant, I have taken notice of a vast number of people who held their own existence in abhorrence, and yet I never knew of more than eight who voluntarily put an end to their misery; three negroes, four Englishmen, and a German professor named Robek.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor pginternal">[14]</a> I ended by being servant to the Jew, Don Issachar, who placed me near your presence, my fair lady. I am determined to share your fate, and have been much more affected with your misfortunes than with my own. I would never even have spoken to you of my misfortunes, had you not piqued me a little, and if it were not customary to tell stories on board a ship in order to pass away the time. In short, Miss Cunegonde, I have had experience, I know the world; therefore I advise you to divert yourself, and prevail upon each passenger to tell his story; and if there be one of them all, that has not cursed his life many a time, that has not frequently looked upon himself as the unhappiest of mortals, I give you leave to throw me headforemost into the sea."<a id="Page_54" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 54]"></a></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00032">XIII</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00033">HOW CANDIDE WAS FORCED AWAY FROM HIS FAIR CUNEGONDE AND THE OLD WOMAN.</h3>
<p>The beautiful Cunegonde having heard the old woman's history, paid her all the civilities due to a person of her rank and merit. She likewise accepted her proposal, and engaged all the passengers, one after the other, to relate their adventures; and then both she and Candide allowed that the old woman was in the right.</p>
<p>"It is a great pity," said Candide, "that the sage Pangloss was hanged contrary to custom at an <i>auto-da-fé</i>; he would tell us most amazing things in regard to the physical and moral evils that overspread earth and sea, and I should be able, with due respect, to make a few objections."</p>
<p>While each passenger was recounting his story, the ship made her way. They landed at Buenos Ayres. Cunegonde, Captain Candide, and the old woman, waited on the Governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza. This nobleman had a stateliness becoming a person who bore so many<a id="Page_55" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 55]"></a> names. He spoke to men with so noble a disdain, carried his nose so loftily, raised his voice so unmercifully, assumed so imperious an air, and stalked with such intolerable pride, that those who saluted him were strongly inclined to give him a good drubbing. Cunegonde appeared to him the most beautiful he had ever met. The first thing he did was to ask whether she was not the captain's wife. The manner in which he asked the question alarmed Candide; he durst not say she was his wife, because indeed she was not; neither durst he say she was his sister, because it was not so; and although this obliging lie had been formerly much in favour among the ancients, and although it could be useful to the moderns, his soul was too pure to betray the truth.</p>
<p>"Miss Cunegonde," said he, "is to do me the honour to marry me, and we beseech your excellency to deign to sanction our marriage."</p>
<p>Don Fernando d'Ibaraa, y Figueora, y Mascarenes, y Lampourdos, y Souza, turning up his moustachios, smiled mockingly, and ordered Captain Candide to go and review his company. Candide obeyed, and the Governor remained alone with Miss Cunegonde. He declared his passion, protesting he would marry her the next day in the face of the church, or otherwise, just as should be agreeable to herself. Cunegonde<a id="Page_56" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 56]"></a> asked a quarter of an hour to consider of it, to consult the old woman, and to take her resolution.</p>
<p>The old woman spoke thus to Cunegonde:</p>
<p>"Miss, you have seventy-two quarterings, and not a farthing; it is now in your power to be wife to the greatest lord in South America, who has very beautiful moustachios. Is it for you to pique yourself upon inviolable fidelity? You have been ravished by Bulgarians; a Jew and an Inquisitor have enjoyed your favours. Misfortune gives sufficient excuse. I own, that if I were in your place, I should have no scruple in marrying the Governor and in making the fortune of Captain Candide."</p>
<p>While the old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience gave, a small ship entered the port on board of which were an Alcalde and his alguazils, and this was what had happened.</p>
<p>As the old woman had shrewdly guessed, it was a Grey Friar who stole Cunegonde's money and jewels in the town of Badajos, when she and Candide were escaping. The Friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to a jeweller; the jeweller knew them to be the Grand Inquisitor's. The Friar before he was hanged confessed he had stolen them. He described the persons, and the route they had taken. The flight of Cunegonde<a id="Page_57" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 57]"></a> and Candide was already known. They were traced to Cadiz. A vessel was immediately sent in pursuit of them. The vessel was already in the port of Buenos Ayres. The report spread that the Alcalde was going to land, and that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the Grand Inquisitor. The prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.</p>
<p>"You cannot run away," said she to Cunegonde, "and you have nothing to fear, for it was not you that killed my lord; besides the Governor who loves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated; therefore stay."</p>
<p>She then ran immediately to Candide.</p>
<p>"Fly," said she, "or in an hour you will be burnt."</p>
<p>There was not a moment to lose; but how could he part from Cunegonde, and where could he flee for shelter?<a id="Page_58" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 58]"></a></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00034">XIV</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00035">HOW CANDIDE AND CACAMBO WERE RECEIVED BY THE JESUITS OF PARAGUAY.</h3>
<p>Candide had brought such a valet with him from Cadiz, as one often meets with on the coasts of Spain and in the American colonies. He was a quarter Spaniard, born of a mongrel in Tucuman; he had been singing-boy, sacristan, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. His name was Cacambo, and he loved his master, because his master was a very good man. He quickly saddled the two Andalusian horses.</p>
<p>"Come, master, let us follow the old woman's advice; let us start, and run without looking behind us."</p>
<p>Candide shed tears.</p>
<p>"Oh! my dear Cunegonde! must I leave you just at a time when the Governor was going to sanction our nuptials? Cunegonde, brought to such a distance what will become of you?"</p>
<p>"She will do as well as she can," said Cacambo; "the women are never at a loss, God provides for them, let us run."</p>
<p>"Whither art thou carrying me? Where shall<a id="Page_59" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 59]"></a> we go? What shall we do without Cunegonde?" said Candide.</p>
<p>"By St. James of Compostella," said Cacambo, "you were going to fight against the Jesuits; let us go to fight for them; I know the road well, I'll conduct you to their kingdom, where they will be charmed to have a captain that understands the Bulgarian exercise. You'll make a prodigious fortune; if we cannot find our account in one world we shall in another. It is a great pleasure to see and do new things."</p>
<p>"You have before been in Paraguay, then?" said Candide.</p>
<p>"Ay, sure," answered Cacambo, "I was servant in the College of the Assumption, and am acquainted with the government of the good Fathers as well as I am with the streets of Cadiz. It is an admirable government. The kingdom is upwards of three hundred leagues in diameter, and divided into thirty provinces; there the Fathers possess all, and the people nothing; it is a masterpiece of reason and justice. For my part I see nothing so divine as the Fathers who here make war upon the kings of Spain and Portugal, and in Europe confess those kings; who here kill Spaniards, and in Madrid send them to heaven; this delights me, let us push forward. You are going to be the happiest of mortals. What pleasure will it be to those<a id="Page_60" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 60]"></a> Fathers to hear that a captain who knows the Bulgarian exercise has come to them!"</p>
<p>As soon as they reached the first barrier, Cacambo told the advanced guard that a captain wanted to speak with my lord the Commandant. Notice was given to the main guard, and immediately a Paraguayan officer ran and laid himself at the feet of the Commandant, to impart this news to him. Candide and Cacambo were disarmed, and their two Andalusian horses seized. The strangers were introduced between two files of musketeers; the Commandant was at the further end, with the three-cornered cap on his head, his gown tucked up, a sword by his side, and a spontoon<a id="FNanchor_15_15"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor pginternal">[15]</a> in his hand. He beckoned, and straightway the new-comers were encompassed by four-and-twenty soldiers. A sergeant told them they must wait, that the Commandant could not speak to them, and that the reverend Father Provincial does not suffer any Spaniard to open his mouth but in his presence, or to stay above three hours in the province.</p>
<p>"And where is the reverend Father Provincial?" said Cacambo.</p>
<p>"He is upon the parade just after celebrating mass," answered the sergeant, "and you cannot kiss his spurs till three hours hence."</p>
<p>"However," said Cacambo, "the captain is not a Spaniard, but a German, he is ready to perish<a id="Page_61" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 61]"></a> with hunger as well as myself; cannot we have something for breakfast, while we wait for his reverence?"</p>
<p>The sergeant went immediately to acquaint the Commandant with what he had heard.</p>
<p>"God be praised!" said the reverend Commandant, "since he is a German, I may speak to him; take him to my arbour."</p>
<p>Candide was at once conducted to a beautiful summer-house, ornamented with a very pretty colonnade of green and gold marble, and with trellises, enclosing parraquets, humming-birds, fly-birds, guinea-hens, and all other rare birds. An excellent breakfast was provided in vessels of gold; and while the Paraguayans were eating maize out of wooden dishes, in the open fields and exposed to the heat of the sun, the reverend Father Commandant retired to his arbour.</p>
<p>He was a very handsome young man, with a full face, white skin but high in colour; he had an arched eyebrow, a lively eye, red ears, vermilion lips, a bold air, but such a boldness as neither belonged to a Spaniard nor a Jesuit. They returned their arms to Candide and Cacambo, and also the two Andalusian horses; to whom Cacambo gave some oats to eat just by the arbour, having an eye upon them all the while for fear of a surprise.<a id="Page_62" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 62]"></a></p>
<p>Candide first kissed the hem of the Commandant's robe, then they sat down to table.</p>
<p>"You are, then, a German?" said the Jesuit to him in that language.</p>
<p>"Yes, reverend Father," answered Candide.</p>
<p>As they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great amazement, and with such an emotion as they could not conceal.</p>
<p>"And from what part of Germany do you come?" said the Jesuit.</p>
<p>"I am from the dirty province of Westphalia," answered Candide; "I was born in the Castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh."</p>
<p>"Oh! Heavens! is it possible?" cried the Commandant.</p>
<p>"What a miracle!" cried Candide.</p>
<p>"Is it really you?" said the Commandant.</p>
<p>"It is not possible!" said Candide.</p>
<p>They drew back; they embraced; they shed rivulets of tears.</p>
<p>"What, is it you, reverend Father? You, the brother of the fair Cunegonde! You, that was slain by the Bulgarians! You, the Baron's son! You, a Jesuit in Paraguay! I must confess this is a strange world that we live in. Oh, Pangloss! Pangloss! how glad you would be if you had not been hanged!"</p>
<p>The Commandant sent away the negro slaves and the Paraguayans, who served them with<a id="Page_63" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 63]"></a> liquors in goblets of rock-crystal. He thanked God and St. Ignatius a thousand times; he clasped Candide in his arms; and their faces were all bathed with tears.</p>
<p>"You will be more surprised, more affected, and transported," said Candide, "when I tell you that Cunegonde, your sister, whom you believe to have been ripped open, is in perfect health."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"In your neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres; and I was going to fight against you."</p>
<p>Every word which they uttered in this long conversation but added wonder to wonder. Their souls fluttered on their tongues, listened in their ears, and sparkled in their eyes. As they were Germans, they sat a good while at table, waiting for the reverend Father Provincial, and the Commandant spoke to his dear Candide as follows.<a id="Page_64" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 64]"></a></p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<h2 id="pgepubid00036">XV</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00037">HOW CANDIDE KILLED THE BROTHER OF HIS DEAR CUNEGONDE.</h3>
<p>"I shall have ever present to my memory the dreadful day, on which I saw my father and mother killed, and my sister ravished. When the Bulgarians retired, my dear sister could not be found; but my mother, my father, and myself, with two maid-servants and three little boys all of whom had been slain, were put in a hearse, to be conveyed for interment to a chapel belonging to the Jesuits, within two leagues of our family seat. A Jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water; it was horribly salt; a few drops of it fell into my eyes; the father perceived that my eyelids stirred a little; he put his hand upon my heart and felt it beat. I received assistance, and at the end of three weeks I recovered. You know, my dear Candide, I was very pretty; but I grew much prettier, and the reverend Father Didrie,<a id="FNanchor_16_16"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor pginternal">[16]</a> Superior of that House, conceived the tenderest friendship for me; he gave me the habit of the order, some years after I was sent to Rome. The Father-General<a id="Page_65" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 65]"></a> needed new levies of young German-Jesuits. The sovereigns of Paraguay admit as few Spanish Jesuits as possible; they prefer those of other nations as being more subordinate to their commands. I was judged fit by the reverend Father-General to go and work in this vineyard. We set out—a Pole, a Tyrolese, and myself. Upon my arrival I was honoured with a sub-deaconship and a lieutenancy. I am to-day colonel and priest. We shall give a warm reception to the King of Spain's troops; I will answer for it that they shall be excommunicated and well beaten. Providence sends you here to assist us. But is it, indeed, true that my dear sister Cunegonde is in the neighbourhood, with the Governor of Buenos Ayres?"</p>
<p>Candide assured him on oath that nothing was more true, and their tears began afresh.</p>
<p>The Baron could not refrain from embracing Candide; he called him his brother, his saviour.</p>
<p>"Ah! perhaps," said he, "we shall together, my dear Candide, enter the town as conquerors, and recover my sister Cunegonde."</p>
<p>"That is all I want," said Candide, "for I intended to marry her, and I still hope to do so."</p>
<p>"You insolent!" replied the Baron, "would you have the impudence to marry my sister who has seventy-two quarterings! I find thou hast<a id="Page_66" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 66]"></a> the most consummate effrontery to dare to mention so presumptuous a design!"</p>
<p>Candide, petrified at this speech, made answer:</p>
<p>"Reverend Father, all the quarterings in the world signify nothing; I rescued your sister from the arms of a Jew and of an Inquisitor; she has great obligations to me, she wishes to marry me; Master Pangloss always told me that all men are equal, and certainly I will marry her."</p>
<p>"We shall see that, thou scoundrel!" said the Jesuit Baron de Thunder-ten-Tronckh, and that instant struck him across the face with the flat of his sword. Candide in an instant drew his rapier, and plunged it up to the hilt in the Jesuit's belly; but in pulling it out reeking hot, he burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Good God!" said he, "I have killed my old master, my friend, my brother-in-law! I am the best-natured creature in the world, and yet I have already killed three men, and of these three two were priests."</p>
<p>Cacambo, who stood sentry by the door of the arbour, ran to him.</p>
<p>"We have nothing more for it than to sell our lives as dearly as we can," said his master to him, "without doubt some one will soon enter the arbour, and we must die sword in hand."</p>
<p>Cacambo, who had been in a great many<a id="Page_67" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 67]"></a> scrapes in his lifetime, did not lose his head; he took the Baron's Jesuit habit, put it on Candide, gave him the square cap, and made him mount on horseback. All this was done in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>"Let us gallop fast, master, everybody will take you for a Jesuit, going to give directions to your men, and we shall have passed the frontiers before they will be able to overtake us."</p>
<p>He flew as he spoke these words, crying out aloud in Spanish:</p>
<p>"Make way, make way, for the reverend Father Colonel."<a id="Page_68" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 68]"></a></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00038">XVI</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00039">ADVENTURES OF THE TWO TRAVELLERS, WITH TWO GIRLS, TWO MONKEYS, AND THE SAVAGES CALLED OREILLONS.</h3>
<p>Candide and his valet had got beyond the barrier, before it was known in the camp that the German Jesuit was dead. The wary Cacambo had taken care to fill his wallet with bread, chocolate, bacon, fruit, and a few bottles of wine. With their Andalusian horses they penetrated into an unknown country, where they perceived no beaten track. At length they came to a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills. Here our two adventurers fed their horses. Cacambo proposed to his master to take some food, and he set him an example.</p>
<p>"How can you ask me to eat ham," said Candide, "after killing the Baron's son, and being doomed never more to see the beautiful Cunegonde? What will it avail me to spin out my wretched days and drag them far from her in remorse and despair? And what will the <i>Journal of Trevoux</i><a id="FNanchor_17_17"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor pginternal">[17]</a> say?"</p>
<p>While he was thus lamenting his fate, he<a id="Page_69" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 69]"></a> went on eating. The sun went down. The two wanderers heard some little cries which seemed to be uttered by women. They did not know whether they were cries of pain or joy; but they started up precipitately with that inquietude and alarm which every little thing inspires in an unknown country. The noise was made by two naked girls, who tripped along the mead, while two monkeys were pursuing them and biting their buttocks. Candide was moved with pity; he had learned to fire a gun in the Bulgarian service, and he was so clever at it, that he could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching a leaf of the tree. He took up his double-barrelled Spanish fusil, let it off, and killed the two monkeys.</p>
<p>"God be praised! My dear Cacambo, I have rescued those two poor creatures from a most perilous situation. If I have committed a sin in killing an Inquisitor and a Jesuit, I have made ample amends by saving the lives of these girls. Perhaps they are young ladies of family; and this adventure may procure us great advantages in this country."</p>
<p>He was continuing, but stopped short when he saw the two girls tenderly embracing the monkeys, bathing their bodies in tears, and rending the air with the most dismal lamentations.</p>
<p>"Little did I expect to see such good-nature,"<a id="Page_70" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 70]"></a> said he at length to Cacambo; who made answer:</p>
<p>"Master, you have done a fine thing now; you have slain the sweethearts of those two young ladies."</p>
<p>"The sweethearts! Is it possible? You are jesting, Cacambo, I can never believe it!"</p>
<p>"Dear master," replied Cacambo; "you are surprised at everything. Why should you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys which insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies; they are a fourth part human, as I am a fourth part Spaniard."</p>
<p>"Alas!" replied Candide, "I remember to have heard Master Pangloss say, that formerly such accidents used to happen; that these mixtures were productive of Centaurs, Fauns, and Satyrs; and that many of the ancients had seen such monsters, but I looked upon the whole as fabulous."</p>
<p>"You ought now to be convinced," said Cacambo, "that it is the truth, and you see what use is made of those creatures, by persons that have not had a proper education; all I fear is that those ladies will play us some ugly trick."</p>
<p>These sound reflections induced Candide to leave the meadow and to plunge into a wood. He supped there with Cacambo; and after cursing the Portuguese inquisitor, the Governor of Buenos Ayres, and the Baron, they fell asleep<a id="Page_71" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 71]"></a> on moss. On awaking they felt that they could not move; for during the night the Oreillons, who inhabited that country, and to whom the ladies had denounced them, had bound them with cords made of the bark of trees. They were encompassed by fifty naked Oreillons, armed with bows and arrows, with clubs and flint hatchets. Some were making a large cauldron boil, others were preparing spits, and all cried:</p>
<p>"A Jesuit! a Jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent cheer, let us eat the Jesuit, let us eat him up!"</p>
<p>"I told you, my dear master," cried Cacambo sadly, "that those two girls would play us some ugly trick."</p>
<p>Candide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried:</p>
<p>"We are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. Ah! what would Master Pangloss say, were he to see how pure nature is formed? Everything is right, may be, but I declare it is very hard to have lost Miss Cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by Oreillons."</p>
<p>Cacambo never lost his head.</p>
<p>"Do not despair," said he to the disconsolate Candide, "I understand a little of the jargon of these people, I will speak to them."</p>
<p>"Be sure," said Candide, "to represent to them<a id="Page_72" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 72]"></a> how frightfully inhuman it is to cook men, and how very un-Christian."</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said Cacambo, "you reckon you are to-day going to feast upon a Jesuit. It is all very well, nothing is more unjust than thus to treat your enemies. Indeed, the law of nature teaches us to kill our neighbour, and such is the practice all over the world. If we do not accustom ourselves to eating them, it is because we have better fare. But you have not the same resources as we; certainly it is much better to devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits of your victory. But, gentlemen, surely you would not choose to eat your friends. You believe that you are going to spit a Jesuit, and he is your defender. It is the enemy of your enemies that you are going to roast. As for myself, I was born in your country; this gentleman is my master, and, far from being a Jesuit, he has just killed one, whose spoils he wears; and thence comes your mistake. To convince you of the truth of what I say, take his habit and carry it to the first barrier of the Jesuit kingdom, and inform yourselves whether my master did not kill a Jesuit officer. It will not take you long, and you can always eat us if you find that I have lied to you. But I have told you the truth. You are too well acquainted<a id="Page_73" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 73]"></a> with the principles of public law, humanity, and justice not to pardon us."</p>
<p>The Oreillons found this speech very reasonable. They deputed two of their principal people with all expedition to inquire into the truth of the matter; these executed their commission like men of sense, and soon returned with good news. The Oreillons untied their prisoners, showed them all sorts of civilities, offered them girls, gave them refreshment, and reconducted them to the confines of their territories, proclaiming with great joy:</p>
<p>"He is no Jesuit! He is no Jesuit!"</p>
<p>Candide could not help being surprised at the cause of his deliverance.</p>
<p>"What people!" said he; "what men! what manners! If I had not been so lucky as to run Miss Cunegonde's brother through the body, I should have been devoured without redemption. But, after all, pure nature is good, since these people, instead of feasting upon my flesh, have shown me a thousand civilities, when then I was not a Jesuit."<a id="Page_74" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 74]"></a></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00040">XVII</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00041">ARRIVAL OF CANDIDE AND HIS VALET AT EL DORADO, AND WHAT THEY SAW THERE.</h3>
<p>"You see," said Cacambo to Candide, as soon as they had reached the frontiers of the Oreillons, "that this hemisphere is not better than the others, take my word for it; let us go back to Europe by the shortest way."</p>
<p>"How go back?" said Candide, "and where shall we go? to my own country? The Bulgarians and the Abares are slaying all; to Portugal? there I shall be burnt; and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of being spitted. But how can I resolve to quit a part of the world where my dear Cunegonde resides?"</p>
<p>"Let us turn towards Cayenne," said Cacambo, "there we shall find Frenchmen, who wander all over the world; they may assist us; God will perhaps have pity on us."</p>
<p>It was not easy to get to Cayenne; they knew vaguely in which direction to go, but rivers, precipices, robbers, savages, obstructed them all the way. Their horses died of fatigue. Their provisions were consumed; they fed a whole<a id="Page_75" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 75]"></a> month upon wild fruits, and found themselves at last near a little river bordered with cocoa trees, which sustained their lives and their hopes.</p>
<p>Cacambo, who was as good a counsellor as the old woman, said to Candide:</p>
<p>"We are able to hold out no longer; we have walked enough. I see an empty canoe near the river-side; let us fill it with cocoanuts, throw ourselves into it, and go with the current; a river always leads to some inhabited spot. If we do not find pleasant things we shall at least find new things."</p>
<p>"With all my heart," said Candide, "let us recommend ourselves to Providence."</p>
<p>They rowed a few leagues, between banks, in some places flowery, in others barren; in some parts smooth, in others rugged. The stream ever widened, and at length lost itself under an arch of frightful rocks which reached to the sky. The two travellers had the courage to commit themselves to the current. The river, suddenly contracting at this place, whirled them along with a dreadful noise and rapidity. At the end of four-and-twenty hours they saw daylight again, but their canoe was dashed to pieces against the rocks. For a league they had to creep from rock to rock, until at length they discovered an extensive plain, bounded by inaccessible mountains. The country was cultivated<a id="Page_76" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 76]"></a> as much for pleasure as for necessity. On all sides the useful was also the beautiful. The roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages of a glittering form and substance, in which were men and women of surprising beauty, drawn by large red sheep which surpassed in fleetness the finest coursers of Andalusia, Tetuan, and Mequinez.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor pginternal">[18]</a></p>
<p>"Here, however, is a country," said Candide, "which is better than Westphalia."</p>
<p>He stepped out with Cacambo towards the first village which he saw. Some children dressed in tattered brocades played at quoits on the outskirts. Our travellers from the other world amused themselves by looking on. The quoits were large round pieces, yellow, red, and green, which cast a singular lustre! The travellers picked a few of them off the ground; this was of gold, that of emeralds, the other of rubies—the least of them would have been the greatest ornament on the Mogul's throne.</p>
<p>"Without doubt," said Cacambo, "these children must be the king's sons that are playing at quoits!"</p>
<p>The village schoolmaster appeared at this moment and called them to school.</p>
<p>"There," said Candide, "is the preceptor of the royal family."</p>
<p>The little truants immediately quitted their<a id="Page_77" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 77]"></a> game, leaving the quoits on the ground with all their other playthings. Candide gathered them up, ran to the master, and presented them to him in a most humble manner, giving him to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had forgotten their gold and jewels. The schoolmaster, smiling, flung them upon the ground; then, looking at Candide with a good deal of surprise, went about his business.</p>
<p>The travellers, however, took care to gather up the gold, the rubies, and the emeralds.</p>
<p>"Where are we?" cried Candide. "The king's children in this country must be well brought up, since they are taught to despise gold and precious stones."</p>
<p>Cacambo was as much surprised as Candide. At length they drew near the first house in the village. It was built like an European palace. A crowd of people pressed about the door, and there were still more in the house. They heard most agreeable music, and were aware of a delicious odour of cooking. Cacambo went up to the door and heard they were talking Peruvian; it was his mother tongue, for it is well known that Cacambo was born in Tucuman, in a village where no other language was spoken.</p>
<p>"I will be your interpreter here," said he to Candide; "let us go in, it is a public-house."</p>
<p>Immediately two waiters and two girls,<a id="Page_78" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 78]"></a> dressed in cloth of gold, and their hair tied up with ribbons, invited them to sit down to table with the landlord. They served four dishes of soup, each garnished with two young parrots; a boiled condor<a id="FNanchor_19_19"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor pginternal">[19]</a> which weighed two hundred pounds; two roasted monkeys, of excellent flavour; three hundred humming-birds in one dish, and six hundred fly-birds in another; exquisite ragouts; delicious pastries; the whole served up in dishes of a kind of rock-crystal. The waiters and girls poured out several liqueurs drawn from the sugar-cane.</p>
<p>Most of the company were chapmen and waggoners, all extremely polite; they asked Cacambo a few questions with the greatest circumspection, and answered his in the most obliging manner.</p>
<p>As soon as dinner was over, Cacambo believed as well as Candide that they might well pay their reckoning by laying down two of those large gold pieces which they had picked up. The landlord and landlady shouted with laughter and held their sides. When the fit was over:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said the landlord, "it is plain you are strangers, and such guests we are not accustomed to see; pardon us therefore for laughing when you offered us the pebbles from our highroads in payment of your reckoning. You doubtless have not the money of the country;<a id="Page_79" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 79]"></a> but it is not necessary to have any money at all to dine in this house. All hostelries established for the convenience of commerce are paid by the government. You have fared but very indifferently because this is a poor village; but everywhere else, you will be received as you deserve."</p>
<p>Cacambo explained this whole discourse with great astonishment to Candide, who was as greatly astonished to hear it.</p>
<p>"What sort of a country then is this," said they to one another; "a country unknown to all the rest of the world, and where nature is of a kind so different from ours? It is probably the country where all is well; for there absolutely must be one such place. And, whatever Master Pangloss might say, I often found that things went very ill in Westphalia."<a id="Page_80" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 80]"></a></p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<h2 id="pgepubid00042">XVIII</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00043">WHAT THEY SAW IN THE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO.</h3>
<p>Cacambo expressed his curiosity to the landlord, who made answer:</p>
<p>"I am very ignorant, but not the worse on that account. However, we have in this neighbourhood an old man retired from Court who is the most learned and most communicative person in the kingdom."</p>
<p>At once he took Cacambo to the old man. Candide acted now only a second character, and accompanied his valet. They entered a very plain house, for the door was only of silver, and the ceilings were only of gold, but wrought in so elegant a taste as to vie with the richest. The antechamber, indeed, was only encrusted with rubies and emeralds, but the order in which everything was arranged made amends for this great simplicity.</p>
<p>The old man received the strangers on his sofa, which was stuffed with humming-birds' feathers, and ordered his servants to present them with liqueurs in diamond goblets; after<a id="Page_81" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 81]"></a> which he satisfied their curiosity in the following terms:</p>
<p>"I am now one hundred and seventy-two years old, and I learnt of my late father, Master of the Horse to the King, the amazing revolutions of Peru, of which he had been an eyewitness. The kingdom we now inhabit is the ancient country of the Incas, who quitted it very imprudently to conquer another part of the world, and were at length destroyed by the Spaniards.</p>
<p>"More wise by far were the princes of their family, who remained in their native country; and they ordained, with the consent of the whole nation, that none of the inhabitants should ever be permitted to quit this little kingdom; and this has preserved our innocence and happiness. The Spaniards have had a confused notion of this country, and have called it <i>El Dorado</i>; and an Englishman, whose name was Sir Walter Raleigh, came very near it about a hundred years ago; but being surrounded by inaccessible rocks and precipices, we have hitherto been sheltered from the rapaciousness of European nations, who have an inconceivable passion for the pebbles and dirt of our land, for the sake of which they would murder us to the last man."</p>
<p>The conversation was long: it turned chiefly on their form of government, their manners,<a id="Page_82" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 82]"></a> their women, their public entertainments, and the arts. At length Candide, having always had a taste for metaphysics, made Cacambo ask whether there was any religion in that country.</p>
<p>The old man reddened a little.</p>
<p>"How then," said he, "can you doubt it? Do you take us for ungrateful wretches?"</p>
<p>Cacambo humbly asked, "What was the religion in El Dorado?"</p>
<p>The old man reddened again.</p>
<p>"Can there be two religions?" said he. "We have, I believe, the religion of all the world: we worship God night and morning."</p>
<p>"Do you worship but one God?" said Cacambo, who still acted as interpreter in representing Candide's doubts.</p>
<p>"Surely," said the old man, "there are not two, nor three, nor four. I must confess the people from your side of the world ask very extraordinary questions."</p>
<p>Candide was not yet tired of interrogating the good old man; he wanted to know in what manner they prayed to God in El Dorado.</p>
<p>"We do not pray to Him," said the worthy sage; "we have nothing to ask of Him; He has given us all we need, and we return Him thanks without ceasing."</p>
<p>Candide having a curiosity to see the priests<a id="Page_83" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 83]"></a> asked where they were. The good old man smiled.</p>
<p>"My friend," said he, "we are all priests. The King and all the heads of families sing solemn canticles of thanksgiving every morning, accompanied by five or six thousand musicians."</p>
<p>"What! have you no monks who teach, who dispute, who govern, who cabal, and who burn people that are not of their opinion?"</p>
<p>"We must be mad, indeed, if that were the case," said the old man; "here we are all of one opinion, and we know not what you mean by monks."</p>
<p>During this whole discourse Candide was in raptures, and he said to himself:</p>
<p>"This is vastly different from Westphalia and the Baron's castle. Had our friend Pangloss seen El Dorado he would no longer have said that the castle of Thunder-ten-Tronckh was the finest upon earth. It is evident that one must travel."</p>
<p>After this long conversation the old man ordered a coach and six sheep to be got ready, and twelve of his domestics to conduct the travellers to Court.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said he, "if my age deprives me of the honour of accompanying you. The King will receive you in a manner that cannot displease you; and no doubt you will make<a id="Page_84" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 84]"></a> an allowance for the customs of the country, if some things should not be to your liking."</p>
<p>Candide and Cacambo got into the coach, the six sheep flew, and in less than four hours they reached the King's palace situated at the extremity of the capital. The portal was two hundred and twenty feet high, and one hundred wide; but words are wanting to express the materials of which it was built. It is plain such materials must have prodigious superiority over those pebbles and sand which we call gold and precious stones.</p>
<p>Twenty beautiful damsels of the King's guard received Candide and Cacambo as they alighted from the coach, conducted them to the bath, and dressed them in robes woven of the down of humming-birds; after which the great crown officers, of both sexes, led them to the King's apartment, between two files of musicians, a thousand on each side. When they drew near to the audience chamber Cacambo asked one of the great officers in what way he should pay his obeisance to his Majesty; whether they should throw themselves upon their knees or on their stomachs; whether they should put their hands upon their heads or behind their backs; whether they should lick the dust off the floor; in a word, what was the ceremony?</p>
<p>"The custom," said the great officer, "is to<a id="Page_85" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 85]"></a> embrace the King, and to kiss him on each cheek."</p>
<p>Candide and Cacambo threw themselves round his Majesty's neck. He received them with all the goodness imaginable, and politely invited them to supper.</p>
<p>While waiting they were shown the city, and saw the public edifices raised as high as the clouds, the market places ornamented with a thousand columns, the fountains of spring water, those of rose water, those of liqueurs drawn from sugar-cane, incessantly flowing into the great squares, which were paved with a kind of precious stone, which gave off a delicious fragrancy like that of cloves and cinnamon. Candide asked to see the court of justice, the parliament. They told him they had none, and that they were strangers to lawsuits. He asked if they had any prisons, and they answered no. But what surprised him most and gave him the greatest pleasure was the palace of sciences, where he saw a gallery two thousand feet long, and filled with instruments employed in mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>After rambling about the city the whole afternoon, and seeing but a thousandth part of it, they were reconducted to the royal palace, where Candide sat down to table with his Majesty, his valet Cacambo, and several ladies. Never was<a id="Page_86" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 86]"></a> there a better entertainment, and never was more wit shown at a table than that which fell from his Majesty. Cacambo explained the King's <i>bon-mots</i> to Candide, and notwithstanding they were translated they still appeared to be <i>bon-mots</i>. Of all the things that surprised Candide this was not the least.</p>
<p>They spent a month in this hospitable place. Candide frequently said to Cacambo:</p>
<p>"I own, my friend, once more that the castle where I was born is nothing in comparison with this; but, after all, Miss Cunegonde is not here, and you have, without doubt, some mistress in Europe. If we abide here we shall only be upon a footing with the rest, whereas, if we return to our old world, only with twelve sheep laden with the pebbles of El Dorado, we shall be richer than all the kings in Europe. We shall have no more Inquisitors to fear, and we may easily recover Miss Cunegonde."</p>
<p>This speech was agreeable to Cacambo; mankind are so fond of roving, of making a figure in their own country, and of boasting of what they have seen in their travels, that the two happy ones resolved to be no longer so, but to ask his Majesty's leave to quit the country.</p>
<p>"You are foolish," said the King. "I am sensible that my kingdom is but a small place, but when a person is comfortably settled in any<a id="Page_87" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 87]"></a> part he should abide there. I have not the right to detain strangers. It is a tyranny which neither our manners nor our laws permit. All men are free. Go when you wish, but the going will be very difficult. It is impossible to ascend that rapid river on which you came as by a miracle, and which runs under vaulted rocks. The mountains which surround my kingdom are ten thousand feet high, and as steep as walls; they are each over ten leagues in breadth, and there is no other way to descend them than by precipices. However, since you absolutely wish to depart, I shall give orders to my engineers to construct a machine that will convey you very safely. When we have conducted you over the mountains no one can accompany you further, for my subjects have made a vow never to quit the kingdom, and they are too wise to break it. Ask me besides anything that you please."</p>
<p>"We desire nothing of your Majesty," says Candide, "but a few sheep laden with provisions, pebbles, and the earth of this country."</p>
<p>The King laughed.</p>
<p>"I cannot conceive," said he, "what pleasure you Europeans find in our yellow clay, but take as much as you like, and great good may it do you."</p>
<p>At once he gave directions that his engineers should construct a machine to hoist up these two<a id="Page_88" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 88]"></a> extraordinary men out of the kingdom. Three thousand good mathematicians went to work; it was ready in fifteen days, and did not cost more than twenty million sterling in the specie of that country. They placed Candide and Cacambo on the machine. There were two great red sheep saddled and bridled to ride upon as soon as they were beyond the mountains, twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions, thirty with presents of the curiosities of the country, and fifty with gold, diamonds, and precious stones. The King embraced the two wanderers very tenderly.</p>
<p>Their departure, with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep were hoisted over the mountains, was a splendid spectacle. The mathematicians took their leave after conveying them to a place of safety, and Candide had no other desire, no other aim, than to present his sheep to Miss Cunegonde.</p>
<p>"Now," said he, "we are able to pay the Governor of Buenos Ayres if Miss Cunegonde can be ransomed. Let us journey towards Cayenne. Let us embark, and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to purchase."<a id="Page_89" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 89]"></a></p>

<h2 id="pgepubid00044">XIX</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00045">WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT SURINAM AND HOW CANDIDE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH MARTIN.</h3>
<p>Our travellers spent the first day very agreeably. They were delighted with possessing more treasure than all Asia, Europe, and Africa could scrape together. Candide, in his raptures, cut Cunegonde's name on the trees. The second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass, where they and their burdens were lost; two more died of fatigue a few days after; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert; and others subsequently fell down precipices. At length, after travelling a hundred days, only two sheep remained. Said Candide to Cacambo:</p>
<p>"My friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; there is nothing solid but virtue, and the happiness of seeing Cunegonde once more."</p>
<p>"I grant all you say," said Cacambo, "but we have still two sheep remaining, with more treasure than the King of Spain will ever have; and I see a town which I take to be Surinam, belonging<a id="Page_90" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 90]"></a> to the Dutch. We are at the end of all our troubles, and at the beginning of happiness."</p>
<p>As they drew near the town, they saw a negro stretched upon the ground, with only one moiety of his clothes, that is, of his blue linen drawers; the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand.</p>
<p>"Good God!" said Candide in Dutch, "what art thou doing there, friend, in that shocking condition?"</p>
<p>"I am waiting for my master, Mynheer Vanderdendur, the famous merchant," answered the negro.</p>
<p>"Was it Mynheer Vanderdendur," said Candide, "that treated thee thus?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," said the negro, "it is the custom. They give us a pair of linen drawers for our whole garment twice a year. When we work at the sugar-canes, and the mill snatches hold of a finger, they cut off the hand; and when we attempt to run away, they cut off the leg; both cases have happened to me. This is the price at which you eat sugar in Europe. Yet when my mother sold me for ten patagons<a id="FNanchor_20_20"/><a href="4238078708748591997_19942-h-3.htm.html#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor pginternal">[20]</a> on the coast of Guinea, she said to me: 'My dear child, bless our fetiches, adore them for ever; they will make thee live happily; thou hast the honour of being<a id="Page_91" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 91]"></a> the slave of our lords, the whites, which is making the fortune of thy father and mother.' Alas! I know not whether I have made their fortunes; this I know, that they have not made mine. Dogs, monkeys, and parrots are a thousand times less wretched than I. The Dutch fetiches, who have converted me, declare every Sunday that we are all of us children of Adam—blacks as well as whites. I am not a genealogist, but if these preachers tell truth, we are all second cousins. Now, you must agree, that it is impossible to treat one's relations in a more barbarous manner."</p>
<p>"Oh, Pangloss!" cried Candide, "thou hadst not guessed at this abomination; it is the end. I must at last renounce thy optimism."</p>
<p>"What is this optimism?" said Cacambo.</p>
<p>"Alas!" said Candide, "it is the madness of maintaining that everything is right when it is wrong."</p>
<p>Looking at the negro, he shed tears, and weeping, he entered Surinam.</p>
<p>The first thing they inquired after was whether there was a vessel in the harbour which could be sent to Buenos Ayres. The person to whom they applied was a Spanish sea-captain, who offered to agree with them upon reasonable terms. He appointed to meet them at a public-house, whither Candide and the faithful Cacambo<a id="Page_92" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 92]"></a> went with their two sheep, and awaited his coming.</p>
<p>Candide, who had his heart upon his lips, told the Spaniard all his adventures, and avowed that he intended to elope with Miss Cunegonde.</p>
<p>"Then I will take good care not to carry you to Buenos Ayres," said the seaman. "I should be hanged, and so would you. The fair Cunegonde is my lord's favourite mistress."</p>
<p>This was a thunderclap for Candide: he wept for a long while. At last he drew Cacambo aside.</p>
<p>"Here, my dear friend," said he to him, "this thou must do. We have, each of us in his pocket, five or six millions in diamonds; you are more clever than I; you must go and bring Miss Cunegonde from Buenos Ayres. If the Governor makes any difficulty, give him a million; if he will not relinquish her, give him two; as you have not killed an Inquisitor, they will have no suspicion of you; I'll get another ship, and go and wait for you at Venice; that's a free country, where there is no danger either from Bulgarians, Abares, Jews, or Inquisitors."</p>
<p>Cacambo applauded this wise resolution. He despaired at parting from so good a master, who had become his intimate friend; but the pleasure of serving him prevailed over the pain of leaving him. They embraced with tears;<a id="Page_93" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 93]"></a> Candide charged him not to forget the good old woman. Cacambo set out that very same day. This Cacambo was a very honest fellow.</p>
<p>Candide stayed some time longer in Surinam, waiting for another captain to carry him and the two remaining sheep to Italy. After he had hired domestics, and purchased everything necessary for a long voyage, Mynheer Vanderdendur, captain of a large vessel, came and offered his services.</p>
<p>"How much will you charge," said he to this man, "to carry me straight to Venice—me, my servants, my baggage, and these two sheep?"</p>
<p>The skipper asked ten thousand piastres. Candide did not hesitate.</p>
<p>"Oh! oh!" said the prudent Vanderdendur to himself, "this stranger gives ten thousand piastres unhesitatingly! He must be very rich."</p>
<p>Returning a little while after, he let him know that upon second consideration, he could not undertake the voyage for less than twenty thousand piastres.</p>
<p>"Well, you shall have them," said Candide.</p>
<p>"Ay!" said the skipper to himself, "this man agrees to pay twenty thousand piastres with as much ease as ten."</p>
<p>He went back to him again, and declared that he could not carry him to Venice for less than thirty thousand piastres.<a id="Page_94" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 94]"></a></p>
<p>"Then you shall have thirty thousand," replied Candide.</p>
<p>"Oh! oh!" said the Dutch skipper once more to himself, "thirty thousand piastres are a trifle to this man; surely these sheep must be laden with an immense treasure; let us say no more about it. First of all, let him pay down the thirty thousand piastres; then we shall see."</p>
<p>Candide sold two small diamonds, the least of which was worth more than what the skipper asked for his freight. He paid him in advance. The two sheep were put on board. Candide followed in a little boat to join the vessel in the roads. The skipper seized his opportunity, set sail, and put out to sea, the wind favouring him. Candide, dismayed and stupefied, soon lost sight of the vessel.</p>
<p>"Alas!" said he, "this is a trick worthy of the old world!"</p>
<p>He put back, overwhelmed with sorrow, for indeed he had lost sufficient to make the fortune of twenty monarchs. He waited upon the Dutch magistrate, and in his distress he knocked over loudly at the door. He entered and told his adventure, raising his voice with unnecessary vehemence. The magistrate began by fining him ten thousand piastres for making a noise; then he listened patiently, promised to examine into his affair at the skipper's return, and ordered<a id="Page_95" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 95]"></a> him to pay ten thousand piastres for the expense of the hearing.</p>
<p>This drove Candide to despair; he had, indeed, endured misfortunes a thousand times worse; the coolness of the magistrate and of the skipper who had robbed him, roused his choler and flung him into a deep melancholy. The villainy of mankind presented itself before his imagination in all its deformity, and his mind was filled with gloomy ideas. At length hearing that a French vessel was ready to set sail for Bordeaux, as he had no sheep laden with diamonds to take along with him he hired a cabin at the usual price. He made it known in the town that he would pay the passage and board and give two thousand piastres to any honest man who would make the voyage with him, upon condition that this man was the most dissatisfied with his state, and the most unfortunate in the whole province.</p>
<p>Such a crowd of candidates presented themselves that a fleet of ships could hardly have held them. Candide being desirous of selecting from among the best, marked out about one-twentieth of them who seemed to be sociable men, and who all pretended to merit his preference. He assembled them at his inn, and gave them a supper on condition that each took an oath to relate his history faithfully, promising to choose him who appeared to be most justly<a id="Page_96" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 96]"></a> discontented with his state, and to bestow some presents upon the rest.</p>
<p>They sat until four o'clock in the morning. Candide, in listening to all their adventures, was reminded of what the old woman had said to him in their voyage to Buenos Ayres, and of her wager that there was not a person on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes. He dreamed of Pangloss at every adventure told to him.</p>
<p>"This Pangloss," said he, "would be puzzled to demonstrate his system. I wish that he were here. Certainly, if all things are good, it is in El Dorado and not in the rest of the world."</p>
<p>At length he made choice of a poor man of letters, who had worked ten years for the booksellers of Amsterdam. He judged that there was not in the whole world a trade which could disgust one more.</p>
<p>This philosopher was an honest man; but he had been robbed by his wife, beaten by his son, and abandoned by his daughter who got a Portuguese to run away with her. He had just been deprived of a small employment, on which he subsisted; and he was persecuted by the preachers of Surinam, who took him for a Socinian. We must allow that the others were at least as wretched as he; but Candide hoped that the philosopher would entertain him during<a id="Page_97" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 97]"></a> the voyage. All the other candidates complained that Candide had done them great injustice; but he appeased them by giving one hundred piastres to each.<a id="Page_98" class="x-ebookmaker-pageno" title="[Pg 98]"></a></p>
