			<p>The archdeacon and the bellringer, as we have already said, were but little loved by the populace great and small, in the vicinity of the cathedral. When Claude and Quasimodo went out together, which frequently happened, and when they were seen traversing in company, the valet behind the master, the cold, narrow, and gloomy streets of the block of Notre-Dame, more than one evil word, more than one ironical quaver, more than one insulting jest greeted them on their way, unless Claude Frollo, which was rarely the case, walked with head upright and raised, showing his severe and almost august brow to the dumbfounded jeerers.</p>
			<p>Both were in their quarter like “the poets” of whom Régnier speaks﻿—</p>
			<blockquote class="epub-type-z3998-poem" epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p class="first-child">
					<span>“All sorts of persons run after poets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As warblers fly shrieking after owls.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Sometimes a mischievous child risked his skin and bones for the ineffable pleasure of driving a pin into Quasimodo’s hump. Again, a young girl, more bold and saucy than was fitting, brushed the priest’s black robe, singing in his face the sardonic ditty, “<i class="xml-lang" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">niche, niche</i>, the devil is caught.” Sometimes a group of squalid old crones, squatting in a file under the shadow of the steps to a porch, scolded noisily as the archdeacon and the bellringer passed, and tossed them this encouraging welcome, with a curse: “Hum! there’s a fellow whose soul is made like the other one’s body!” Or a band of schoolboys and street urchins, playing hopscotch, rose in a body and saluted him classically, with some cry in Latin: “<i class="xml-lang" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eia! eia! Claudius cum claudo!</i>”</p>
			<p>But the insult generally passed unnoticed both by the priest and the bellringer. Quasimodo was too deaf to hear all these gracious things, and Claude was too dreamy.</p>
