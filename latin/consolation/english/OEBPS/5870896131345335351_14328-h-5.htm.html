<p>Then said she: 'This debate about providence is an old one, and is vigorously discussed by Cicero in his "Divination"; thou also hast long and earnestly pondered the problem, yet no one has had diligence and perseverance enough to find a solution. And the reason of this obscurity is that the movement of human reasoning cannot cope with the simplicity of the Divine foreknowledge; for if a conception of its nature could in any wise be framed, no shadow of uncertainty would remain. With a view of making this at last clear and plain, I will begin by considering the arguments by which thou art swayed. First, I inquire into the reasons why thou art dissatisfied with the solution proposed, which is to the effect that, seeing the fact of foreknowledge is not thought the cause of the necessity of future events, foreknowledge is not to be deemed any hindrance to the freedom of the will.<a id="Page_244"/> Now, surely the sole ground on which thou arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are foreknown cannot fail to come to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to acknowledge just now, the fact of foreknowledge imposes no necessity on things future, what reason is there for supposing the results of voluntary action constrained to a fixed issue? Suppose, for the sake of argument, and to see what follows, we assume that there is no foreknowledge. Are willed actions, then, tied down to any necessity in <em>this</em> case?'</p>
<p>'Certainly not.'</p>
<p>'Let us assume foreknowledge again, but without its involving any actual necessity; the freedom of the will, I imagine, will remain in complete integrity. But thou wilt say that, even although the foreknowledge is not the necessity of the future event's occurrence, yet it is a sign that it will necessarily happen. Granted; but in this case it is plain that, even if there had been no foreknowledge, the issues would have been inevitably certain. For a sign only indicates something which is, does not bring to pass that of which it is the <a id="Page_245"/>sign. We require to show beforehand that all things, without exception, happen of necessity in order that a preconception may be a sign of this necessity. Otherwise, if there is no such universal necessity, neither can any preconception be a sign of a necessity which exists not. Manifestly, too, a proof established on firm grounds of reason must be drawn not from signs and loose general arguments, but from suitable and necessary causes. But how can it be that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why, this is to suppose us to believe that the events which providence foresees to be coming were not about to happen, instead of our supposing that, although they should come to pass, yet there was no necessity involved in their own nature compelling their occurrence. Take an illustration that will help to convey my meaning. There are many things which we see taking place before our eyes—the movements of charioteers, for instance, in guiding and turning their cars, and so on. Now, is any one of these movements compelled by any necessity?'<a id="Page_246"/></p>
<p>'No; certainly not. There would be no efficacy in skill if all motions took place perforce.'</p>
<p>'Then, things which in taking place are free from any necessity as to their being in the present must also, before they take place, be about to happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will come to pass, the occurrence of which is perfectly free from necessity. At all events, I imagine that no one will deny that things now taking place were about to come to pass before they were actually happening. Such things, however much foreknown, are in their occurrence <em>free</em>. For even as knowledge of things present imports no necessity into things that are taking place, so foreknowledge of the future imports none into things that are about to come. But this, thou wilt say, is the very point in dispute—whether any foreknowing is possible of things whose occurrence is not necessary. For here there seems to thee a contradiction, and, if they are foreseen, their necessity follows; whereas if there is no necessity, they can by no means be foreknown; and thou <a id="Page_247"/>thinkest that nothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain, but if things whose occurrence is uncertain are foreknown as certain, this is the very mist of opinion, not the truth of knowledge. For to think of things otherwise than as they are, thou believest to be incompatible with the soundness of knowledge.</p>
<p>'Now, the cause of the mistake is this—that men think that all knowledge is cognized purely by the nature and efficacy of the thing known. Whereas the case is the very reverse: all that is known is grasped not conformably to its own efficacy, but rather conformably to the faculty of the knower. An example will make this clear: the roundness of a body is recognised in one way by sight, in another by touch. Sight looks upon it from a distance as a whole by a simultaneous reflection of rays; touch grasps the roundness piecemeal, by contact and attachment to the surface, and by actual movement round the periphery itself. Man himself, likewise, is viewed in one way by Sense, in another by Imagination, in another way, again, by Thought, in another <a id="Page_248"/>by pure Intelligence. Sense judges figure clothed in material substance, Imagination figure alone without matter. Thought transcends this again, and by its contemplation of universals considers the type itself which is contained in the individual. The eye of Intelligence is yet more exalted; for overpassing the sphere of the universal, it will behold absolute form itself by the pure force of the mind's vision. Wherein the main point to be considered is this: the higher faculty of comprehension embraces the lower, while the lower cannot rise to the higher. For Sense has no efficacy beyond matter, nor can Imagination behold universal ideas, nor Thought embrace pure form; but Intelligence, looking down, as it were, from its higher standpoint in its intuition of form, discriminates also the several elements which underlie it; but it comprehends them in the same way as it comprehends that form itself, which could be cognized by no other than itself. For it cognizes the universal of Thought, the figure of Imagination, and the matter of Sense, without employing Thought, Imagination, or Sense, but <a id="Page_249"/>surveying all things, so to speak, under the aspect of pure form by a single flash of intuition. Thought also, in considering the universal, embraces images and sense-impressions without resorting to Imagination or Sense. For it is Thought which has thus defined the universal from its conceptual point of view: "Man is a two-legged animal endowed with reason." This is indeed a universal notion, yet no one is ignorant that the <em>thing</em> is imaginable and presentable to Sense, because Thought considers it not by Imagination or Sense, but by means of rational conception. Imagination, too, though its faculty of viewing and forming representations is founded upon the senses, nevertheless surveys sense-impressions without calling in Sense, not in the way of Sense-perception, but of Imagination. See'st thou, then, how all things in cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the things which they cognize? Nor is this strange; for since every judgment is the act of the judge, it is necessary that each should accomplish its task by its own, not by another's power.'<a id="Page_250"/></p>

<p>'Now, although in the case of bodies endowed with sentiency the qualities of external objects affect the sense-organs, and the activity of mind is preceded by a bodily affection which calls forth the mind's action upon itself, and stimulates the forms till that moment lying inactive within, yet, I say, if in these bodies endowed with sentiency the mind is not inscribed by mere passive affection, but of its own efficacy discriminates the impressions furnished to the body, how much more do intelligences free from all bodily affections employ in their discrimination their own mental activities instead of conforming to external objects? So on these principles various modes of cognition belong to distinct and different substances. For to creatures void of motive power—shell-fish and other such creatures which cling to rocks and grow there—belongs<a id="Page_253"/> Sense alone, void of all other modes of gaining knowledge; to beasts endowed with movement, in whom some capacity of seeking and shunning seems to have arisen, Imagination also. Thought pertains only to the human race, as Intelligence to Divinity alone; hence it follows that that form of knowledge exceeds the rest which of its own nature cognizes not only its proper object, but the objects of the other forms of knowledge also. But what if Sense and Imagination were to gainsay Thought, and declare that universal which Thought deems itself to behold to be nothing? For the object of Sense and Imagination cannot be universal; so that either the judgment of Reason is true and there is no sense-object, or, since they know full well that many objects are presented to Sense and Imagination, the conception of Reason, which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular as if it were a something "universal," is empty of content. Suppose, further, that Reason maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate the object of both Sense and Imagination under the form of <a id="Page_254"/>universality, while Sense and Imagination cannot aspire to the knowledge of the universal, since their cognizance cannot go beyond bodily figures, and that in the cognition of reality we ought rather to trust the stronger and more perfect faculty of judgment. In a dispute of this sort, should not we, in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as well as of imagining and perceiving, espouse the cause of Reason?</p>
<p>'In like manner is it that human reason thinks that Divine Intelligence cannot see the future except after the fashion in which its own knowledge is obtained. For thy contention is, if events do not appear to involve certain and necessary issues, they cannot be foreseen as certainly about to come to pass. There is, then, no foreknowledge of such events; or, if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there is, there can be nothing which does not happen of necessity. If, however, we could have some part in the judgment of the Divine mind, even as we participate in Reason, we should think it perfectly just that human Reason should submit itself <a id="Page_255"/>to the Divine mind, no less than we judged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to Reason. Wherefore let us soar, if we can, to the heights of that Supreme Intelligence; for there Reason will see what in itself it cannot look upon; and that is in what way things whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a sure and definite foreknowledge; and that this foreknowledge is not conjecture, but rather knowledge in its supreme simplicity, free of all limits and restrictions.'</p>

<p>'Since, then, as we lately proved, everything that is known is cognized not in accordance with its own nature, but in accordance with the nature of the faculty that comprehends it, let us now contemplate, as far as lawful, the character of the Divine essence, that we may be able to understand also the nature of its knowledge.</p>
<p>'God is eternal; in this judgment all rational beings agree. Let us, then, consider what eternity is. For this word carries with it a revelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine knowledge. Now, eternity is the possession of endless life whole and perfect at a single moment. What this is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison with things temporal. For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding from the past to the future, and there is nothing set in <a id="Page_258"/>time which can embrace the whole space of its life together. To-morrow's state it grasps not yet, while it has already lost yesterday's; nay, even in the life of to-day ye live no longer than one brief transitory moment. Whatever, therefore, is subject to the condition of time, although, as Aristotle deemed of the world, it never have either beginning or end, and its life be stretched to the whole extent of time's infinity, it yet is not such as rightly to be thought eternal. For it does not include and embrace the whole space of infinite life at once, but has no present hold on things to come, not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which includes and possesses the whole fulness of unending life at once, from which nothing future is absent, from which nothing past has escaped, this is rightly called eternal; this must of necessity be ever present to itself in full self-possession, and hold the infinity of movable time in an abiding present. Wherefore they deem not rightly who imagine that on Plato's principles the created world is made co-eternal with the Creator, because they are told that he <a id="Page_259"/>believed the world to have had no beginning in time,<a id="FNanchor_S_19"/><a href="5870896131345335351_14328-h-5.htm.html#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor pginternal">[S]</a> and to be destined never to come to an end. For it is one thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged, which was what Plato ascribed to the world, another for the whole of an endless life to be embraced in the present, which is manifestly a property peculiar to the Divine mind. Nor need God appear earlier in mere duration of time to created things, but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature. For the infinite progression of things in time copies this immediate existence in the present of the changeless life, and when it cannot succeed in equalling it, declines from movelessness into motion, and falls away from the simplicity of a perpetual present to the infinite duration of the future and the past; and since it cannot possess the whole fulness of its life together, for the very reason that in a manner it never ceases to be, it seems, up <a id="Page_260"/>to a certain point, to rival that which it cannot complete and express by attaching itself indifferently to any present moment of time, however swift and brief; and since this bears some resemblance to that ever-abiding present, it bestows on everything to which it is assigned the semblance of existence. But since it cannot abide, it hurries along the infinite path of time, and the result has been that it continues by ceaseless movement the life the completeness of which it could not embrace while it stood still. So, if we are minded to give things their right names, we shall follow Plato in saying that God indeed is eternal, but the world everlasting.</p>
<p>'Since, then, every mode of judgment comprehends its objects conformably to its own nature, and since God abides for ever in an eternal present, His knowledge, also transcending all movement of time, dwells in the simplicity of its own changeless present, and, embracing the whole infinite sweep of the past and of the future, contemplates all that falls within its simple cognition as if it were now taking place. And therefore, if thou wilt carefully con<a id="Page_261"/>sider that immediate presentment whereby it discriminates all things, thou wilt more rightly deem it not foreknowledge as of something future, but knowledge of a moment that never passes. For this cause the name chosen to describe it is not prevision, but providence, because, since utterly removed in nature from things mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all things as from some lofty height. Why, then, dost thou insist that the things which are surveyed by the Divine eye are involved in necessity, whereas clearly men impose no necessity on things which they see? Does the act of vision add any necessity to the things which thou seest before thy eyes?'</p>
<p>'Assuredly not.'</p>
<p>'And yet, if we may without unfitness compare God's present and man's, just as ye see certain things in this your temporary present, so does He see all things in His eternal present. Wherefore this Divine anticipation changes not the natures and properties of things, and it beholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter come to pass in time. Nor does it con<a id="Page_262"/>found things in its judgment, but in the one mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what without necessity. For even as ye, when at one and the same time ye see a man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky, distinguish between the two, though one glance embraces both, and judge the former voluntary, the latter necessary action: so also the Divine vision in its universal range of view does in no wise confuse the characters of the things which are present to its regard, though future in respect of time. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will come into existence, and yet is perfectly aware that this is unbound by any necessity, its apprehension is not opinion, but rather knowledge based on truth. And if to this thou sayest that what God sees to be about to come to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to come to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word necessity, I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth, but one which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the<a id="Page_263"/> Divine his special study. For my answer would be that the same future event is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge, but when considered in its own nature it seems absolutely free and unfettered. So, then, there are two necessities—one simple, as that men are necessarily mortal; the other conditioned, as that, if you know that someone is walking, he must necessarily be walking. For that which is known cannot indeed be otherwise than as it is known to be, and yet this fact by no means carries with it that other simple necessity. For the former necessity is not imposed by the thing's own proper nature, but by the addition of a condition. No necessity compels one who is voluntarily walking to go forward, although it is necessary for him to go forward at the moment of walking. In the same way, then, if Providence sees anything as present, that must necessarily be, though it is bound by no necessity of nature. Now, God views as present those coming events which happen of free will. These, accordingly, from the standpoint of the Divine vision are made necessary <a id="Page_264"/>conditionally on the Divine cognizance; viewed, however, in themselves, they desist not from the absolute freedom naturally theirs. Accordingly, without doubt, all things will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of these certain proceed of free will; and though these happen, yet by the fact of their existence they do not lose their proper nature, in virtue of which before they happened it was really possible that they might not have come to pass.</p>
<p>'What difference, then, does the denial of necessity make, since, through their being conditioned by Divine knowledge, they come to pass as if they were in all respects under the compulsion of necessity? This difference, surely, which we saw in the case of the instances I formerly took, the sun's rising and the man's walking; which at the moment of their occurrence could not but be taking place, and yet one of them before it took place was necessarily obliged to be, while the other was not so at all. So likewise the things which to God are present without doubt exist, but some of them come from the <a id="Page_265"/>necessity of things, others from the power of the agent. Quite rightly, then, have we said that these things are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine knowledge; but if they are considered in themselves, they are free from the bonds of necessity, even as everything which is accessible to sense, regarded from the standpoint of Thought, is universal, but viewed in its own nature particular. "But," thou wilt say, "if it is in my power to change my purpose, I shall make void providence, since I shall perchance change something which comes within its foreknowledge." My answer is: Thou canst indeed turn aside thy purpose; but since the truth of providence is ever at hand to see that thou canst, and whether thou dost, and whither thou turnest thyself, thou canst not avoid the Divine foreknowledge, even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present spectator, although of thy free will thou turn thyself to various actions. Wilt thou, then, say: "Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at my discretion, so that, when I will this or that, providence changes its knowledge correspondingly?"<a id="Page_266"/></p>
<p>'Surely not.'</p>
<p>'True, for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming, and transforms and reduces it to the form of its own present knowledge, and varies not, as thou deemest, in its foreknowledge, alternating to this or that, but in a single flash it forestalls and includes thy mutations without altering. And this ever-present comprehension and survey of all things God has received, not from the issue of future events, but from the simplicity of His own nature. Hereby also is resolved the objection which a little while ago gave thee offence—that our doings in the future were spoken of as if supplying the cause of God's knowledge. For this faculty of knowledge, embracing all things in its immediate cognizance, has itself fixed the bounds of all things, yet itself owes nothing to what comes after.</p>
<p>'And all this being so, the freedom of man's will stands unshaken, and laws are not unrighteous, since their rewards and punishments are held forth to wills unbound by any necessity. God, who foreknoweth all things, still looks down from above, and the ever-present eternity of<a id="Page_267"/> His vision concurs with the future character of all our acts, and dispenseth to the good rewards, to the bad punishments. Our hopes and prayers also are not fixed on God in vain, and when they are rightly directed cannot fail of effect. Therefore, withstand vice, practise virtue, lift up your souls to right hopes, offer humble prayers to Heaven. Great is the necessity of righteousness laid upon you if ye will not hide it from yourselves, seeing that all your actions are done before the eyes of a Judge who seeth all things.'<a id="Page_268"/></p>

<br/>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

<br/>
<br/>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
<br/>one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
<br/>(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
<br/>permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
<br/>set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
<br/>copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
<br/>protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
<br/>Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
<br/>charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
<br/>do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
<br/>rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
<br/>such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
<br/>research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
<br/>practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
<br/>subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
<br/>redistribution.

<br/>
<br/>*** START: FULL LICENSE ***
<br/>
<br/>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
<br/>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
<br/>
<br/>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
<br/>distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
<br/>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<br/>https://gutenberg.org/license).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic works
<br/>
<br/>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
<br/>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
<br/>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
<br/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
<br/>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
<br/>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
<br/>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
<br/>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
<br/>
<br/>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
<br/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
<br/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
<br/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
<br/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
<br/>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
<br/>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
<br/>
<br/>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
<br/>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
<br/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
<br/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
<br/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
<br/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
<br/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
<br/>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
<br/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
<br/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
<br/>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
<br/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
<br/>
<br/>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
<br/>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
<br/>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
<br/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
<br/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
<br/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
<br/>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
<br/>States.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
<br/>
<br/>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
<br/>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
<br/>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
<br/>phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
<br/>Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
<br/>copied or distributed:
<br/>
<br/>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
<br/>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
<br/>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
<br/>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
<br/>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
<br/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
<br/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
<br/>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
<br/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
<br/>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
<br/>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
<br/>1.E.9.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
<br/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
<br/>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
<br/>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
<br/>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
<br/>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
<br/>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
<br/>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
<br/>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
<br/>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm License.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
<br/>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
<br/>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
<br/>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
<br/>"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
<br/>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
<br/>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
<br/>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
<br/>request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
<br/>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
<br/>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
<br/>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
<br/>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
<br/>that
<br/>
<br/>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
<br/>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
<br/>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
<br/>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
<br/>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
<br/>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
<br/>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
<br/>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
<br/>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
<br/>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
<br/>     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
<br/>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
<br/>
<br/>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
<br/>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
<br/>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>     License.  You must require such a user to return or
<br/>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
<br/>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
<br/>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
<br/>
<br/>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
<br/>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
<br/>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
<br/>     of receipt of the work.
<br/>
<br/>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
<br/>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
<br/>
<br/>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
<br/>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
<br/>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
<br/>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
<br/>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
<br/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
<br/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
<br/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
<br/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
<br/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
<br/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
<br/>your equipment.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
<br/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
<br/>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
<br/>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
<br/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
<br/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
<br/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
<br/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
<br/>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br/>DAMAGE.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
<br/>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
<br/>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
<br/>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
<br/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
<br/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
<br/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
<br/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
<br/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
<br/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
<br/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
<br/>opportunities to fix the problem.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
<br/>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
<br/>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
<br/>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
<br/>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
<br/>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
<br/>law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
<br/>interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
<br/>the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
<br/>provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
<br/>
<br/>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
<br/>trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
<br/>providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
<br/>with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
<br/>promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
<br/>harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
<br/>that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
<br/>or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
<br/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
<br/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
<br/>because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
<br/>people in all walks of life.
<br/>
<br/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
<br/>assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
<br/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
<br/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
<br/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
<br/>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
<br/>To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
<br/>and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
<br/>Foundation
<br/>
<br/>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
<br/>501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
<br/>state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
<br/>Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
<br/>number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
<br/>https://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
<br/>permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
<br/>Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
<br/>throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at
<br/>809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email
<br/>business@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact

<br/>     Chief Executive and Director
<br/>     gbnewby@pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
<br/>Literary Archive Foundation
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
<br/>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
<br/>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
<br/>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
<br/>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
<br/>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
<br/>status with the IRS.
<br/>
<br/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
<br/>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
<br/>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
<br/>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
<br/>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
<br/>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<br/>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
<br/>particular state visit https://pglaf.org
<br/>
<br/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
<br/>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
<br/>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
<br/>approach us with offers to donate.
<br/>
<br/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
<br/>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
<br/>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
<br/>
<br/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
<br/>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
<br/>ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
<br/>donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
<br/>works.
<br/>
<br/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
<br/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
<br/>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
<br/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
<br/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
<br/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
<br/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<br/>
<br/>     https://www.gutenberg.org
<br/>
<br/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
<br/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
<br/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
<br/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
