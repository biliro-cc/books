<p id="id00028">In preparing the text of the <i>Consolatio</i> I have used the apparatus in
Peiper's edition (Teubner, 1871), since his reports, as I know in the case
of the Tegernseensis, are generally accurate and complete; I have depended
also on my own collations or excerpts from various of the important
manuscripts, nearly all of which I have at least examined, and I have also
followed, not always but usually, the opinions of Engelbrecht in his
admirable article, <i>Die Consolatio Philosophiae des Boethius</i> in the
<i>Sitzungsberichte</i> of the Vienna Academy, cxliv. (1902) 1-60. The
present text, then, has been constructed from only part of the material
with which an editor should reckon, though the reader may at least assume
that every reading in the text has, unless otherwise stated, the authority
of some manuscript of the ninth or tenth century; in certain orthographical
details, evidence from the text of the <i>Opuscula Sacra</i> has been used
without special mention of this fact. We look to August Engelbrecht for the
first critical edition of the <i>Consolatio</i> at, we hope, no distant
date.</p>

<p id="id00029">The text of the <i>Opuscula Sacra</i> is based on my own collations of all
the important manuscripts of these works. An edition with complete
<i>apparatus criticus</i> will be ready before long for the Vienna
<i>Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum</i>. The history of the
text of the <i>Opuscula Sacra</i>, as I shall attempt to show elsewhere, is
intimately connected with that of the <i>Consolatio</i>.</p>

<h5 id="id00030">E.K.R.</h5>

<h2 id="id00031" style="margin-top: 4em">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p id="id00032">Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, of the famous Praenestine family of the
Anicii, was born about 480 A.D. in Rome. His father was an ex-consul; he
himself was consul under Theodoric the Ostrogoth in 510, and his two sons,
children of a great grand-daughter of the renowned Q. Aurelius Symmachus,
were joint consuls in 522. His public career was splendid and honourable,
as befitted a man of his race, attainments, and character. But he fell
under the displeasure of Theodoric, and was charged with conspiring to
deliver Rome from his rule, and with corresponding treasonably to this end
with Justin, Emperor of the East. He was thrown into prison at Pavia, where
he wrote the <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i>, and he was brutally put to death
in 524. His brief and busy life was marked by great literary achievement.
His learning was vast, his industry untiring, his object unattainableâ€”
nothing less than the transmission to his countrymen of all the works of
Plato and Aristotle, and the reconciliation of their apparently divergent
views. To form the idea was a silent judgment on the learning of his day;
to realize it was more than one man could accomplish; but Boethius
accomplished much. He translated the [Greek: Eisagogae] of Porphyry, and
the whole of Aristotle's <i>Organon</i>. He wrote a double commentary on the
[Greek: Eisagogae] and commentaries on the <i>Categories</i> and the <i>De
Interpretatione</i> of Aristotle, and on the <i>Topica</i> of Cicero. He also
composed original treatises on the categorical and hypothetical syllogism,
on Division and on Topical Differences. He adapted the arithmetic of
Nicomachus, and his textbook on music, founded on various Greek
authorities, was in use at Oxford and Cambridge until modern times. His
five theological <i>Tractates</i> are here, together with the <i>Consolation of
Philosophy</i>, to speak for themselves.</p>

<p id="id00033">Boethius was the last of the Roman philosophers, and the first of the
scholastic theologians. The present volume serves to prove the truth of
both these assertions.</p>

<p id="id00034">The <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> is indeed, as Gibbon called it, "a golden
volume, not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or of Tully." To belittle its
originality and sincerity, as is sometimes done, with a view to saving the
Christianity of the writer, is to misunderstand his mind and his method.
The <i>Consolatio</i> is not, as has been maintained, a mere patchwork of
translations from Aristotle and the Neoplatonists. Rather it is the supreme
essay of one who throughout his life had found his highest solace in the
dry light of reason. His chief source of refreshment, in the dungeon to
which his beloved library had not accompanied him, was a memory well
stocked with the poetry and thought of former days. The development of the
argument is anything but Neoplatonic; it is all his own.</p>

<p id="id00035">And if the <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> admits Boethius to the company of
Cicero or even of Plato, the theological <i>Tractates</i> mark him as the
forerunner of St. Thomas. It was the habit of a former generation to regard
Boethius as an eclectic, the transmitter of a distorted Aristotelianism, a
pagan, or at best a luke-warm Christian, who at the end cast off the faith
which he had worn in times of peace, and wrapped himself in the philosophic
cloak which properly belonged to him. The authenticity of the <i>Tractates</i>
was freely denied. We know better now. The discovery by Alfred Holder, and
the illuminating discussion by Hermann Usener,[1] of a fragment of
Cassiodorus are sufficient confirmation of the manuscript tradition, apart
from the work of scholars who have sought to justify that tradition from
internal evidence. In that fragment Cassiodorus definitely ascribes to his
friend Boethius "a book on the Trinity, some dogmatic chapters, and a book
against Nestorius."[2] Boethius was without doubt a Christian, a Doctor and
perhaps a martyr. Nor is it necessary to think that, when in prison, he put
away his faith. If it is asked why the <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> contains
no conscious or direct reference to the doctrines which are traced in the
<i>Tractates</i> with so sure a hand, and is, at most, not out of harmony with
Christianity, the answer is simple. In the <i>Consolation</i> he is writing
philosophy; in the <i>Tractates</i> he is writing theology. He observes what
Pascal calls the orders of things. Philosophy belongs to one order,
theology to another. They have different objects. The object of philosophy
is to understand and explain the nature of the world around us; the object
of theology is to understand and explain doctrines delivered by divine
revelation. The scholastics recognized the distinction,[3] and the
corresponding difference in the function of Faith and Reason. Their final
aim was to co-ordinate the two, but this was not possible before the
thirteenth century. Meanwhile Boethius helps to prepare the way. In the
<i>Consolation</i> he gives Reason her range, and suffers her, unaided, to
vindicate the ways of Providence. In the <i>Tractates</i> Reason is called in to
give to the claims of Faith the support which it does not really lack.[4]
Reason, however, has still a right to be heard. The distinction between
<i>fides</i> and <i>ratio</i> is proclaimed in the first two <i>Tractates</i>. In the
second especially it is drawn with a clearness worthy of St. Thomas
himself; and there is, of course, the implication that the higher authority
resides with <i>fides</i>. But the treatment is philosophical and extremely
bold. Boethius comes back to the question of the substantiality of the
divine Persons which he has discussed in Tr. I. from a fresh point of view.
Once more he decides that the Persons are predicated relatively; even
Trinity, he concludes, is not predicated substantially of deity. Does this
square with catholic doctrine? It is possible to hear a note of challenge
in his words to John the Deacon, <i>fidem si poterit rationemque coniunge</i>.
Philosophy states the problem in unequivocal terms. Theology is required to
say whether they commend themselves.</p>

<p id="id00036">One object of the scholastics, anterior to the final co-ordination of the
two sciences, was to harmonize and codify all the answers to all the
questions that philosophy raises. The ambition of Boethius was not so
soaring, but it was sufficiently bold. He set out, first to translate, and
then to reconcile, Plato and Aristotle; to go behind all the other systems,
even the latest and the most in vogue, back to the two great masters, and
to show that they have the truth, and are in substantial accord. So St.
Thomas himself, if he cannot reconcile the teaching of Plato and Aristotle,
at least desires to correct the one by the other, to discover what truth is
common to both, and to show its correspondence with Christian doctrine. It
is reasonable to conjecture that Boethius, if he had lived, might have
attempted something of the kind. Were he alive to-day, he might feel more
in tune with the best of the pagans than with most contemporary philosophic
thought.</p>

<p id="id00037">In yet one more respect Boethius belongs to the company of the schoolmen.
He not only put into circulation many precious philosophical notions,
served as channel through which various works of Aristotle passed into the
schools, and handed down to them a definite Aristotelian method for
approaching the problem of faith; he also supplied material for that
classification of the various sciences which is an essential accompaniment
of every philosophical movement, and of which the Middle Ages felt the
value.[5] The uniform distribution into natural sciences, mathematics and
theology which he recommends may be traced in the work of various teachers
up to the thirteenth century, when it is finally accepted and defended by
St. Thomas in his commentary on the <i>De Trinitate</i>.</p>

<p id="id00038">A seventeenth-century translation of the <i>Consolatio Philosophiae</i> is here
presented with such alterations as are demanded by a better text, and the
requirements of modern scholarship. There was, indeed, not much to do, for
the rendering is most exact. This in a translation of that date is not a
little remarkable. We look for fine English and poetry in an Elizabethan;
but we do not often get from him such loyalty to the original as is here
displayed.</p>

<p id="id00039">Of the author "I.T." nothing is known. He may have been John Thorie, a
Fleming born in London in 1568, and a B.A. of Christ Church, 1586. Thorie
"was a person well skilled in certain tongues, and a noted poet of his
times" (Wood, <i>Athenae Oxon.</i> ed. Bliss, i. 624), but his known
translations are apparently all from the Spanish.[6]</p>

<p id="id00040">Our translator dedicates his "Five books of Philosophical Comfort" to the
Dowager Countess of Dorset, widow of Thomas Sackville, who was part author
of <i>A Mirror for Magistrates</i> and <i>Gorboduc</i>, and who, we learn from I.T.'s
preface, meditated a similar work. I.T. does not unduly flatter his
patroness, and he tells her plainly that she will not understand the
philosophy of the book, though the theological and practical parts may be
within her scope.</p>

<p id="id00041">The <i>Opuscula Sacra</i> have never before, to our knowledge, been translated.
In reading and rendering them we have been greatly helped by two mediaeval
commentaries: one by John the Scot (edited by E.K. Rand in Traube's
<i>Quellen und Untersuchungen</i>, vol. i. pt. 2, Munich, 1906); the other by
Gilbert de la PorrÃ©e (printed in Migne, <i>P.L.</i> lxiv.). We also desire to
record our indebtedness in many points of scholarship and philosophy to Mr.
E.J. Thomas of Emmanuel College.</p>

<p id="id00042">Finally, thanks are due to Mr. Dolson for the suggestion in the footnote on
the preceding page, and also to Professor Lane Cooper of Cornell University
for many valuable corrections as this reprint was passing through the
Press.</p>

  light that God has lent me. Now, having set it forth in logical order
  and cast it into literary form, I venture to submit it to your judgment,
  for which I care as much as for the results of my own research. You will
  readily understand what I feel whenever I try to write down what I think
  if you consider the difficulty of the topic and the fact that I discuss
  it only with the fewâ€”I may say with no one but yourself. It is indeed
  no desire for fame or empty popular applause that prompts my pen; if
  there be any external reward, we may not look for more warmth in the
  verdict than the subject itself arouses. For, apart from yourself,
  wherever I turn my eyes, they fall on either the apathy of the dullard
  or the jealousy of the shrewd, and a man who casts his thoughts before
  the common herdâ€”I will not say to consider but to trample under foot,
  would seem to bring discredit on the study of divinity. So I purposely
  use brevity and wrap up the ideas I draw from the deep questionings of
  philosophy in new and unaccustomed words which speak only to you and to
  myself, that is, if you deign to look at them. The rest of the world I
  simply disregard: they cannot understand, and therefore do not deserve
  to read. We should not of course press our inquiry further than man's
  wit and reason are allowed to climb the height of heavenly knowledge.[8]
  In all the liberal arts we see the same limit set beyond which reason
  may not reach. Medicine, for instance, does not always bring health to
  the sick, though the doctor will not be to blame if he has left nothing
  undone which he ought to do. So with the other arts. In the present case
  the very difficulty of the quest claims a lenient judgment. You must
  however examine whether the seeds sown in my mind by St. Augustine's
  writings[9] have borne fruit. And now let us begin our inquiry.</p>

  Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God. Therefore Father,
  Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, not three Gods. The principle of this
  union is absence of difference[10]: difference cannot be avoided by
  those who add to or take from the Unity, as for instance the Arians,
  who, by graduating the Trinity according to merit, break it up and
  convert it to Plurality. For the essence of plurality is otherness;
  apart from otherness plurality is unintelligible. In fact, the
  difference between three or more things lies in genus or species or
  number. Difference is the necessary correlative of sameness. Sameness is
  predicated in three ways: By genus; e.g. a man and a horse, because of
  their common genus, animal. By species; e.g. Cato and Cicero, because of
  their common species, man. By number; e.g. Tully and Cicero, because
  they are numerically one. Similarly difference is expressed by genus,
  species, and number. Now numerical difference is caused by variety of
  accidents; three men differ neither by genus nor species but by their
  accidents, for if we mentally remove from them all other accidents,[11]
  still each one occupies a different place which cannot possibly be
  regarded as the same for each, since two bodies cannot occupy the same
  place, and place is an accident. Wherefore it is because men are plural
  by their accidents that they are plural in number.</p>

<p id="id00102" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  We will now begin a careful consideration of each several point, as far
  as they can be grasped and understood; for it has been wisely said,[12]
  in my opinion, that it is a scholar's duty to formulate his belief about
  anything according to its real nature.</p>

<p id="id00103" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Speculative Science may be divided into three kinds[13]: Physics,
  Mathematics, and Theology. Physics deals with motion and is not abstract
  or separable (i.e. [Greek: anupexairetos]); for it is concerned with the
  forms of bodies together with their constituent matter, which forms
  cannot be separated in reality from their bodies.[14] As the bodies are
  in motionâ€”the earth, for instance, tending downwards, and fire tending
  upwards, form takes on the movement of the particular thing to which it
  is annexed.</p>

<p id="id00104" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Mathematics does not deal with motion and is not abstract, for it
  investigates forms of bodies apart from matter, and therefore apart from
  movement, which forms, however, being connected with matter cannot be
  really separated from bodies.</p>

<p id="id00105" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Theology does not deal with motion and is abstract and separable, for
  the Divine Substance is without either matter or motion. In Physics,
  then, we are bound to use scientific, in Mathematics, systematical, in
  Theology, intellectual concepts; and in Theology we will not let
  ourselves be diverted to play with imaginations, but will simply
  apprehend that Form which is pure form and no image, which is very Being
  and the source of Being. For everything owes its being to Form. Thus a
  statue is not a statue on account of the brass which is its matter, but
  on account of the form whereby the likeness of a living thing is
  impressed upon it: the brass itself is not brass because of the earth
  which is its matter, but because of its form. Likewise earth is not
  earth by reason of unqualified matter,[15] but by reason of dryness and
  weight, which are forms. So nothing is said to be because it has matter,
  but because it has a distinctive form. But the Divine Substance is Form
  without matter, and is therefore One, and is its own essence. But other
  things are not simply their own essences, for each thing has its being
  from the things of which it is composed, that is, from its parts. It is
  This <i>and</i> That, i.e. it is the totality of its parts in
  conjunction; it is not This <i>or</i> That taken apart. Earthly man, for
  instance, since he consists of soul and body, is soul <i>and</i> body,
  not soul <i>or</i> body, separately; therefore he is not his own
  essence. That on the other hand which does not consist of This and That,
  but is only This, is really its own essence, and is altogether beautiful
  and stable because it is not grounded in anything. Wherefore that is
  truly One in which is no number, in which nothing is present except its
  own essence. Nor can it become the substrate of anything, for it is pure
  Form, and pure Forms cannot be substrates.[16] For if humanity, like
  other forms, is a substrate for accidents, it does not receive accidents
  through the fact that it exists, but through the fact that matter is
  subjected to it. Humanity appears indeed to appropriate the accident
  which in reality belongs to the matter underlying the conception
  Humanity. But Form which is without matter cannot be a substrate, and
  cannot have its essence in matter, else it would not be form but a
  reflexion. For from those forms which are outside matter come the forms
  which are in matter and produce bodies. We misname the entities that
  reside in bodies when we call them forms; they are mere images; they
  only resemble those forms which are not incorporate in matter. In Him,
  then, is no difference, no plurality arising out of difference, no
  multiplicity arising out of accidents, and accordingly no number.</p>

<p id="id00112">Deus uero a deo nullo differt, ne uel accidentibus uel substantialibus

nulla est omnino pluralitas, quare nec numerus; igitur unitas tantum. Nam
quod tertio repetitur deus, cum pater ac filius et spiritus sanctus
nuncupatur, tres unitates non faciunt pluralitatem numeri in eo quod ipsae
sunt, si aduertamus ad res numerabiles ac non ad ipsum numerum. Illic enim
unitatum repetitio numerum facit. In eo autem numero qui in rebus
numerabilibus constat, repetitio unitatum atque pluralitas minime facit
numerabilium rerum numerosam diuersitatem. Numerus enim duplex est, unus
quidem quo numeramus, alter uero qui in rebus numerabilibus constat. Etenim
unum res est; unitas, quo unum dicimus. Duo rursus in rebus sunt ut homines

repetitio unitatum facit pluralitatem; in rerum uero numero non facit
pluralitatem unitatum repetitio, uel si de eodem dicam "gladius unus mucro
unus ensis unus." Potest enim unus tot uocabulis gladius agnosci; haec enim
unitatum iteratio potius est non numeratio, uelut si ita dicamus "ensis

<p id="id00113">Non igitur si de patre ac filio et spiritu sancto tertio praedicatur deus,

<h2 id="id00115" style="margin-top: 4em">  III.</h2>

<p id="id00116" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Now God differs from God in no respect, for there cannot be divine
  essences distinguished either by accidents or by substantial differences
  belonging to a substrate. But where there is no difference, there is no
  sort of plurality and accordingly no number; here, therefore, is unity
  alone. For whereas we say God thrice when we name the Father, Son, and
  Holy Spirit, these three unities do not produce a plurality of number in
  their own essences, if we think of what we count instead of what we
  count with. For in the case of abstract number a repetition of single
  items does produce plurality; but in the case of concrete number the
  repetition and plural use of single items does not by any means produce
  numerical difference in the objects counted. There are as a fact two
  kinds of number. There is the number with which we count (abstract) and
  the number inherent in the things counted (concrete). "One" is a thingâ€”
  the thing counted. Unity is that by which oneness is denoted. Again
  "two" belongs to the class of things as men or stones; but not so
  duality; duality is merely that whereby two men or two stones are
  denoted; and so on. Therefore a repetition of unities[17] produces
  plurality when it is a question of abstract, but not when it is a
  question of concrete things, as, for example, if I say of one and the
  same thing, "one sword, one brand, one blade."[18]  It is easy to see
  that each of these names denotes a sword; I am not numbering unities but
  simply repeating one thing, and in saying "sword, brand, blade," I
  reiterate the one thing and do not enumerate several different things
  any more than I produce three suns instead of merely mentioning one
  thing thrice when I say "Sun, Sun, Sun."</p>

<p id="id00117" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  So then if God be predicated thrice of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the
  threefold predication does not result in plural number. The risk of
  that, as has been said, attends only on those who distinguish Them
  according to merit. But Catholic Christians, allowing no difference of
  merit in God, assuming Him to be Pure Form and believing Him to be
  nothing else than His own essence, rightly regard the statement "the
  Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God, and this Trinity
  is one God," not as an enumeration of different things but as a
  reiteration of one and the same thing, like the statement, "blade and
  brand are one sword" or "sun, sun, and sun are one sun."</p>

<p id="id00118" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Let this be enough for the present to establish my meaning and to show
  that not every repetition of units produces number and plurality. Still
  in saying "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," we are not using synonymous
  terms. "Brand and blade" are the same and identical, but "Father, Son,
  and Holy Spirit," though the same, are not identical. This point
  deserves a moment's consideration. When they ask "Is the Father the same
  as the Son?" Catholics answer "No." "Is the One the same as the Other?"
  The answer is in the negative. There is not, therefore, complete
  indifference between Them; and so number does come inâ€”number which we
  explained was the result of diversity of substrates. We will briefly
  debate this point when we have done examining how particular predicates
  can be applied to God.</p>

copulate hoc modo: nam cum dicimus "substantia" (ut homo uel deus), ita
dicitur quasi illud de quo praedicatur ipsum sit substantia, ut substantia
homo uel deus. Sed distat, quoniam homo non integre ipsum homo est ac per
hoc nec substantia; quod enim est, aliis debet quae non sunt homo. Deus
uero hoc ipsum deus est; nihil enim aliud est nisi quod est, ac per hoc
ipsum deus est. Rursus "iustus," quod est qualitas, ita dicitur quasi ipse
hoc sit de quo praedicatur, id est si dicamus "homo iustus uel deus
iustus," ipsum hominem uel deum iustos esse proponimus; sed differt, quod
homo alter alter iustus, deus uero idem ipsum est quod est iustum. "Magnus"
etiam homo uel deus dicitur atque ita quasi ipse sit homo magnus uel deus
magnus; sed homo tantum magnus, deus uero ipsum magnus exsistit. Reliqua
uero neque de deo neque de ceteris praedicantur. Nam ubi uel de homine uel
de deo praedicari potest, de homine ut in foro, de deo ut ubique, sed ita
ut non quasi ipsa sit res id quod praedicatur de qua dicitur. Non enim ita
homo dicitur esse in foro quem ad modum esse albus uel longus nec quasi
circumfusus et determinatus proprietate aliqua qua designari secundum se
possit, sed tantum quo sit illud aliis informatum rebus per hanc
praedicationem ostenditur.</p>

<p id="id00124">De deo uero non ita, nam quod ubique est ita dici uidetur non quod in omni
sit loco (omnino enim in loco esse non potest) sed quod omnis ei locus
adsit ad eum capiendum, cum ipse non suscipiatur in loco; atque ideo
nusquam in loco esse dicitur, quoniam ubique est sed non in loco. "Quando"
uero eodem praedicatur modo, ut de homine heri uenit, de deo semper est.
Hic quoque non quasi esse aliquid dicitur illud ipsum de quo hesternus
dicitur aduentus, sed quid ei secundum tempus accesserit praedicatur. Quod
uero de deo dicitur "semper est," unum quidem significat, quasi omni
praeterito fuerit, omni quoquo modo sit praesenti est, omni futuro erit.
Quod de caelo et de ceteris inmortalibus corporibus secundum philosophos
dici potest, at de deo non ita. Semper enim est, quoniam "semper"
praesentis est in eo temporis tantumque inter nostrarum rerum praesens,
quod est nunc, interest ac diuinarum, quod nostrum "nunc" quasi currens
tempus facit et sempiternitatem, diuinum uero "nunc" permanens neque mouens
sese atque consistens aeternitatem facit; cui nomini si adicias "semper,"
facies eius quod est nunc iugem indefessumque ac per hoc perpetuum cursum
quod est sempiternitas.</p>

homine, de deo "cuncta possidens regit." Rursus de eo nihil quod est esse
de utrisque dictum est, sed haec omnis praedicatio exterioribus datur
omniaque haec quodam modo referuntur ad aliud. Cuius praedicationis
differentiam sic facilius internoscimus: qui homo est uel deus refertur ad
substantiam qua est aliquid, id est homo uel deus; qui iustus est refertur
ad qualitatem qua scilicet est aliquid, id est iustus, qui magnus ad
quantitatem qua est aliquid, id est magnus. Nam in ceteris praedicationibus
nihil tale est. Qui enim dicit esse aliquem in foro uel ubique, refert
quidem ad praedicamentum quod est ubi, sed non quo aliquid est uelut
iustitia iustus. Item cum dico "currit" uel "regit" uel "nunc est" uel
"semper est," refertur quidem uel ad facere uel ad tempusâ€”si tamen interim

<p id="id00129" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  There are in all ten categories which can be universally predicated of
  things, namely, Substance, Quality, Quantity, Relation, Place, Time,
  Condition, Situation, Activity, Passivity. Their meaning is determined
  by the contingent subject; for some of them denote substance in making
  predication of other things, others belong to the class of accidents.
  But when these categories are applied to God they change their meaning
  entirely. Relation, for instance, cannot be predicated at all of God;
  for substance in Him is not really substantial but supersubstantial. So
  with quality and the other possible attributes, of which we must add
  examples for the sake of clearness.</p>

<p id="id00130" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  When we say God, we seem to denote a substance; but it is a substance
  that is supersubstantial. When we say of Him, "He is just," we mention a
  quality, not an accidental qualityâ€”rather a substantial and, in fact, a
  supersubstantial quality.[20] For God is not one thing because He is,
  and another thing because He is just; with Him to be just and to be God
  are one and the same. So when we say, "He is great or the greatest," we
  seem to predicate quantity, but it is a quantity similar to this
  substance which we have declared to be supersubstantial; for with Him to
  be great and to be God are all one. Again, concerning His Form, we have
  already shown that He is Form, and truly One without Plurality. The
  categories we have mentioned are such that they give to the thing to
  which they are applied the character which they express; in created
  things they express divided being, in God, conjoined and united beingâ€”
  in the following manner. When we name a substance, as man or God, it
  seems as though that of which the predication is made were substance
  itself, as man or God is substance. But there is a difference: since a
  man is not simply and entirely man, and in virtue of this he is not
  substance. For what man is he owes to other things which are not man.
  But God is simply and entirely God, for He is nothing else than what He
  is, and therefore is, through simple existence, God. Again we apply
  just, a quality, as though it were that of which it is predicated; that
  is, if we say "a just man or just God," we assert that man or God is
  just. But there is a difference, for man is one thing, and a just man is
  another thing. But God is justice itself. So a man or God is said to be
  great, and it would appear that man is substantially great or that God
  is substantially great. But man is merely great; God is greatness.</p>

<p id="id00131" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The remaining categories are not predicable of God nor yet of created
  things.[21]  For place is predicated of man or of Godâ€”a man is in the
  market-place; God is everywhereâ€”but in neither case is the predicate
  identical with the object of predication. To say "A man is in the
  market" is quite a different thing from saying "he is white or long,"
  or, so to speak, encompassed and determined by some property which
  enables him to be described in terms of his substance; this predicate of
  place simply declares how far his substance is given a particular
  setting amid other things.</p>

<p id="id00132" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  It is otherwise, of course, with God. "He is everywhere" does not mean
  that He is in every place, for He cannot be in any place at allâ€”but
  that every place is present to Him for Him to occupy, although He
  Himself can be received by no place, and therefore He cannot anywhere be
  in a place, since He is everywhere but in no place. It is the same with
  the category of time, as, "A man came yesterday; God is ever." Here
  again the predicate of "coming yesterday" denotes not something
  substantial, but something happening in terms of time. But the
  expression "God is ever" denotes a single Present, summing up His
  continual presence in all the past, in all the presentâ€”however that
  term be usedâ€”and in all the future. Philosophers say that "ever" may be
  applied to the life of the heavens and other immortal bodies. But as
  applied to God it has a different meaning. He is ever, because "ever" is
  with Him a term of present time, and there is this great difference
  between "now," which is our present, and the divine present. Our present
  connotes changing time and sempiternity; God's present, abiding,
  unmoved, and immoveable, connotes eternity. Add <i>semper</i> to
  <i>eternity</i> and you get the constant, incessant and thereby
  perpetual course of our present time, that is to say, sempiternity.[22]</p>

<p id="id00133" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  It is just the same with the categories of condition and activity. For
  example, we say "A man runs, clothed," "God rules, possessing all
  things." Here again nothing substantial is asserted of either subject;
  in fact all the categories we have hitherto named arise from what lies
  outside substance, and all of them, so to speak, refer to something
  other than substance. The difference between the categories is easily
  seen by an example. Thus, the terms "man" and "God" refer to the
  substance in virtue of which the subject isâ€”man or God. The term "just"
  refers to the quality in virtue of which the subject is something, viz.
  just; the term "great" to the quantity in virtue of which He is
  something, viz. great. No other category save substance, quality, and
  quantity refer to the substance of the subject. If I say of one "he is
  in the market" or "everywhere," I am applying the category of place,
  which is not a category of the substance, like "just" in virtue of
  justice. So if I say, "he runs, He rules, he is now, He is ever," I make
  reference to activity or timeâ€”if indeed God's "ever" can be described
  as timeâ€”but not to a category of substance, like "great" in virtue of
  greatness.</p>

<p id="id00134" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Finally, we must not look for the categories of situation and passivity
  in God, for they simply are not to be found in Him.</p>

<p id="id00135" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Have I now made clear the difference between the categories? Some denote
  the reality of a thing; others its accidental circumstances; the former
  declare that a thing is something; the latter say nothing about its
  being anything, but simply attach to it, so to speak, something
  external. Those categories which describe a thing in terms of its
  substance may be called substantial categories; when they apply to
  things as subjects they are called accidents. In reference to God, who
  is not a subject at all, it is only possible to employ the category of
  substance.</p>

<p id="id00136" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  [20] Gilbert de la PorrÃ©e in his commentary on the <i>De Trin.</i> makes
  Boethius's meaning clear. "Quod igitur in illo substantiam nominamus,
  non est subiectionis ratione quod dicitur, sed ultra omnem quae
  accidentibus est subiecta substantiam est essentia, absque omnibus quae
  possunt accidere solitaria omnino." (Migne, <i>P.L.</i> lxiv. 1283). Cf. Aug.
  <i>De Trin.</i> vii. 10.</p>

<p id="id00137">  [21] i.e. according to their substance.</p>

<p id="id00138" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  [22] The doctrine is Augustine's, cf. <i>De Ciu. Dei</i>, xi. 6, xii. 16; but
  Boethius's use of <i>sempiternitas</i>, as well as his word-building, seem to
  be peculiar to himself. Claudianus Mamertus, speaking of applying the
  categories to God, uses <i>sempiternitas</i> as Boethius uses <i>aeternitas</i>.
  Cf. <i>De Statu Animae</i> i. 19. Apuleius seems to use both terms
  interchangeably, e.g. <i>Asclep.</i> 29-31. On Boethius's distinction between
  time and eternity see <i>Cons.</i> v. pr. 6, and Rand, <i>i er dem B. zugeschr.
  Trakt. de fide</i>, pp. 425 ff, and Brandt in <i>Theol. Littzg.</i>, 1902, p.

<p id="id00140">Age nunc de relatiuis speculemur pro quibus omne quod dictum est sumpsimus
ad disputationem; maxime enim haec non uidentur secundum se facere
praedicationem quae perspicue ex alieno aduentu constare perspiciuntur. Age
enim, quoniam dominus ac seruus relatiua sunt, uideamus utrumne ita sit ut
secundum se sit praedicatio an minime. Atqui si auferas seruum, abstuleris
et dominum; at non etiam si auferas albedinem, abstuleris quoque album, sed
interest, quod albedo accidit albo, qua sublata perit nimirum album. At in
domino, si seruum auferas, perit uocabulum quo dominus uocabatur; sed non
accidit seruus domino ut albedo albo, sed potestas quaedam qua seruus
coercetur. Quae quoniam sublato deperit seruo, constat non eam per se
domino accidere sed per seruorum quodam modo extrinsecus accessum.</p>

<p id="id00141">Non igitur dici potest praedicationem relatiuam quidquam rei de qua dicitur
secundum se uel addere uel minuere uel mutare. Quae tota non in eo quod est
esse consistit, sed in eo quod est in comparatione aliquo modo se habere,
nec semper ad aliud sed aliquotiens ad idem. Age enim stet quisquam. Ei
igitur si accedam dexter, erit ille sinister ad me comparatus, non quod
ille ipse sinister sit, sed quod ego dexter accesserim. Rursus ego sinister
accedo, item ille fit dexter, non quod ita sit per se dexter uelut albus ac
longus, sed quod me accedente fit dexter atque id quod est a me et ex me
est minime uero ex sese.</p>

<p id="id00142">Quare quae secundum rei alicuius in eo quod ipsa est proprietatem non
faciunt praedicationem, nihil alternare uel mutare queunt nullamque omnino
uariare essentiam. Quocirca si pater ac filius ad aliquid dicuntur nihilque
aliud ut dictum est differunt nisi sola relatione, relatio uero non
praedicatur ad id de quo praedicatur quasi ipsa sit et secundum rem de qua
dicitur, non faciet alteritatem rerum de qua dicitur, sed, si dici potest,
quo quidem modo id quod uix intellegi potuit interpretatum est, personarum.
Omnino enim magna regulae est ueritas in rebus incorporalibus distantias
effici differentiis non locis. Neque accessisse dici potest aliquid deo, ut
pater fieret; non enim coepit esse umquam pater eo quod substantialis
quidem ei est productio filii, relatiua uero praedicatio patris. Ac si
meminimus omnium in prioribus de deo sententiarum, ita cogitemus
processisse quidem ex deo patre filium deum et ex utrisque spiritum
sanctum; hos, quoniam incorporales sint, minime locis distare. Quoniam uero
pater deus et filius deus et spiritus sanctus deus, deus uero nullas habet
differentias quibus differat ab deo, a nullo eorum differt. Differentiae
uero ubi absunt, abest pluralitas; ubi abest pluralitas, adest unitas.
Nihil autem aliud gigni potuit ex deo nisi deus; et in rebus numerabilibus
repetitio unitatum non facit modis omnibus pluralitatem.  Trium igitur
idonee constituta est unitas.</p>

<h2 id="id00143" style="margin-top: 4em">  V.</h2>

<p id="id00144" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Let us now consider the category of relation, to which all the foregoing
  remarks have been preliminary; for qualities which obviously arise from
  the association of another term do not appear to predicate anything
  concerning the substance of a subject. For instance, master and
  slave[23] are relative terms; let us see whether either of them are
  predicates of substance. If you suppress the term slave,[24] you
  simultaneously suppress the term master. On the other hand, though you
  suppress the term whiteness, you do not suppress some white thing,[25]
  though, of course, if the particular whiteness inhere as an accident in
  the thing, the thing disappears as soon as you suppress the accidental
  quality whiteness. But in the case of master, if you suppress the term
  slave, the term master disappears. But slave is not an accidental
  quality of master, as whiteness is of a white thing; it denotes the
  power which the master has over the slave. Now since the power goes when
  the slave is removed, it is plain that power is no accident to the
  substance of master, but is an adventitious augmentation arising from
  the possession of slaves.</p>

<p id="id00145" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  It cannot therefore be affirmed that a category of relation increases,
  decreases, or alters in any way the substance of the thing to which it
  is applied. The category of relation, then, has nothing to do with the
  essence of the subject; it simply denotes a condition of relativity, and
  that not necessarily to something else, but sometimes to the subject
  itself. For suppose a man standing. If I go up to him on my right and
  stand beside him, he will be left, in relation to me, not because he is
  left in himself, but because I have come up to him on my right. Again,
  if I come up to him on my left, he becomes right in relation to me, not
  because he is right in himself, as he may be white or long, but because
  he is right in virtue of my approach. What he is depends entirely on me,
  and not in the least on the essence of his being.</p>

<p id="id00146" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Accordingly those predicates which do not denote the essential nature of
  a thing cannot alter, change, or disturb its nature in any way.
  Wherefore if Father and Son are predicates of relation, and, as we have
  said, have no other difference but that of relation, and if relation is
  not asserted of its subject as though it were the subject itself and its
  substantial quality, it will effect no real difference in its subject,
  but, in a phrase which aims at interpreting what we can hardly
  understand, a difference of persons. For it is a canon of absolute truth
  that distinctions in incorporeal things are established by differences
  and not by spatial separation. It cannot be said that God became Father
  by the addition to His substance of some accident; for he never began to
  be Father, since the begetting of the Son belongs to His very substance;
  however, the predicate father, as such, is relative. And if we bear in
  mind all the propositions made concerning God in the previous
  discussion, we shall admit that God the Son proceeded from God the
  Father, and the Holy Ghost from both, and that They cannot possibly be
  spatially different, since They are incorporeal. But since the Father is
  God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and since there are in
  God no points of difference distinguishing Him from God, He differs from
  none of the Others. But where there are no differences there is no
  plurality; where is no plurality there is Unity. Again, nothing but God
  can be begotten of God, and lastly, in concrete enumerations the
  repetition of units does not produce plurality. Thus the Unity of the
  Three is suitably established.</p>

<p id="id00151">Sed quoniam nulla relatio ad se ipsum referri potest, idcirco quod ea

trinitatis numerositas in eo quod est praedicatio relationis, seruata uero
unitas in eo quod est indifferentia uel substantiae uel operationis uel
omnino eius quae secundum se dicitur praedicationis. Ita igitur substantia
continet unitatem, relatio multiplicat trinitatem; atque ideo sola
singillatim proferuntur atque separatim quae relationis sunt. Nam idem
pater qui filius non est nec idem uterque qui spiritus sanctus. Idem tamen
deus est pater et filius et spiritus sanctus, idem iustus idem bonus idem
