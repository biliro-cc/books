<p id="id00727" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Then I said that I did very well like of Plato's doctrine, for thou dost
  bring these things to my remembrance now the second time, first, because
  I lost their memory by the contagion of my body, and after when I was
  oppressed with the burden of grief. "If," quoth she, "thou reflectest
  upon that which heretofore hath been granted, thou wilt not be far from
  remembering that which in the beginning thou confessedst thyself to be
  ignorant of." "What?" quoth I. "By what government," quoth she, "the
  world is ruled." "I remember," quoth I, "that I did confess my
  ignorance, but though I foresee what thou wilt say, yet I desire to hear
  it more plainly from thyself." "Thou thoughtest a little before that it
  was not to be doubted that this world is governed by God." "Neither do I
  think now," quoth I, "neither will I ever think, that it is to be
  doubted of, and I will briefly explicate the reasons which move me to
  think so. This world could never have been compacted of so many divers
  and contrary parts, unless there were One that doth unite these so
  different things; and this disagreeing diversity of natures being united
  would separate and divide this concord, unless there were One that
  holdeth together that which He united. Neither would the course of
  nature continue so certain, nor would the different parts hold so well-
  ordered motions in due places, times, causality, spaces and qualities,
  unless there were One who, Himself remaining quiet, disposeth and
  ordereth this variety of motions. This, whatsoever it be, by which
  things created continue and are moved, I call God, a name which all men
  use."[141]</p>

<p id="id00728" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "Since," quoth she, "thou art of this mind, I think with little labour
  thou mayest be capable of felicity, and return to thy country in safety.
  But let us consider what we proposed. Have we not placed sufficiency in
  happiness, and granted that God is blessedness itself?" "Yes truly."
  "Wherefore," quoth she, "He will need no outward helps to govern the
  world, otherwise, if He needed anything, He had not full sufficiency."
  "That," quoth I, "must necessarily be so." "Wherefore He disposeth all
  things by Himself." "No doubt He doth," quoth I. "But it hath been
  proved that God is goodness itself." "I remember it very well," quoth I.
  "Then He disposeth all things by goodness: since He governeth all things
  by Himself, whom we have granted to be goodness. And this is as it were
  the helm and rudder by which the frame of the world is kept steadfast
  and uncorrupted." "I most willingly agree," quoth I, "and I foresaw a
  little before, though only with a slender guess, that thou wouldst
  conclude this." "I believe thee," quoth she, "for now I suppose thou
  lookest more watchfully about thee to discern the truth. But that which
  I shall say is no less manifest." "What?" quoth I. "Since that God is
  deservedly thought to govern all things with the helm of goodness, and
  all these things likewise, as I have showed, hasten to goodness with
  their natural contention, can there be any doubt made but that they are
  governed willingly, and that they frame themselves of their own accord
  to their disposer's beck, as agreeable and conformable to their ruler?"
  "It must needs be so," quoth I, "neither would it seem an happy
  government, if it were an imposed yoke, not a desired health." "There is
  nothing then which, following nature, endeavoureth to resist God."
  "Nothing," quoth I. "What if anything doth endeavour," quoth she, "can
  anything prevail against Him, whom we have granted to be most powerful
  by reason of His blessedness?" "No doubt," quoth I, "nothing could
  prevail." "Wherefore there is nothing which either will or can resist
  this sovereign goodness." "I think not," quoth I. "It is then the
  sovereign goodness which governeth all things strongly, and disposeth
  them sweetly." "How much," quoth I, "doth not only the reason which thou
  allegest, but much more the very words which thou usest, delight me,
  that folly which so much vexed me may at length be ashamed of herself."</p>

<p id="id00729" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "Thou hast heard in the poets' fables," quoth she, "how the giants
  provoked heaven, but this benign fortitude put them also down, as they
  deserved. But wilt thou have our arguments contend together? Perhaps by
  this clash there will fly out some beautiful spark of truth." "As it
  pleaseth thee," quoth I. "No man can doubt," quoth she, "but that God is
  almighty." "No man," quoth I, "that is well in his wits." "But," quoth
  she, "there is nothing that He who is almighty cannot do." "Nothing,"
  quoth I. "Can God do evil?" "No," quoth I, "Wherefore," quoth she, "evil
  is nothing, since He cannot do it who can do anything." "Dost thou mock
  me," quoth I, "making with thy reasons an inextricable labyrinth,
  because thou dost now go in where thou meanest to go out again, and
  after go out, where thou camest in, or dost thou frame a wonderful
  circle of the simplicity of God? For a little before taking thy
  beginning from blessedness, thou affirmedst that to be the chiefest good
  which thou saidst was placed in God, and likewise thou provedst, that
  God Himself is the chiefest good and full happiness, out of which thou
  madest me a present of that inference, that no man shall be happy unless
  he be also a God. Again thou toldest me that the form of goodness is the
  substance of God and of blessedness, and that unity is the same with
  goodness, because it is desired by the nature of all things; thou didst
  also dispute that God governeth the whole world with the helm of
  goodness, and that all things obey willingly, and that there is no
  nature of evil, and thou didst explicate all these things with no
  foreign or far-fetched proofs, but with those which were proper and
  drawn from inward principles, the one confirming the other."</p>

<p id="id00730" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "We neither play nor mock," quoth she, "and we have finished the
  greatest matter that can be by the assistance of God, whose aid we
  implored in the beginning. For such is the form of the Divine substance
  that it is neither divided into outward things, nor receiveth any such
  into itself, but as Parmenides saith of it:</p>

<p id="id00731">    In body like a sphere well-rounded on all sides,[142]</p>

<p id="id00732" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  it doth roll about the moving orb of things, while it keepeth itself
  unmovable. And if we have used no far-fetched reasons, but such as were
  placed within the compass of the matter we handled, thou hast no cause
  to marvel, since thou hast learned in Plato's school that our speeches
  must be like and as it were akin to the things we speak of.</p>

<p id="id00749" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  When Philosophy had sung these verses with a soft and sweet voice,
  observing due dignity and gravity in her countenance and gesture, I, not
  having altogether forgotten my inward grief, interrupted her speech
  which she was about to continue, and said: "O thou who bringest us to
  see true light, those things which hitherto thou hast treated of have
  manifestly appeared both to be divine when contemplated apart, and
  invincible when supported by thy reasons, and what thou hast uttered,
  though the force of grief had made me forget it of late, yet heretofore
  I was not altogether ignorant of it. But this is the chiefest cause of
  my sorrow, that since the governor of all things is so good, there can
  either be any evil at all, or that it pass unpunished. Which alone I
  beseech thee consider, how much admiration it deserveth. But there is
  another greater than this; for wickedness bearing rule and sway, virtue
  is not only without reward, but lieth also trodden under the wicked's
  feet, and is punished instead of vice. That which things should be done
  in the kingdom of God, who knoweth all things, can do all things, but
  will do only that which is good, no man can sufficiently admire nor
  complain."</p>

<p id="id00750" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  To which she answered: "It were indeed infinitely strange, and
  surpassing all monsters, if, as thou conceivest, in the best-ordered
  house of so great an householder the vilest vessels were made account of
  and the precious neglected; but it is not so. For if those things which
  were a little before concluded be kept unviolated, thou shalt by His
  help, of whose kingdom we speak, know that the good are always powerful,
  and the evil always abject and weak, and that vices are never without
  punishment, nor virtue without reward, and that the good are always
  prosperous, and the evil unfortunate, and many things of that sort,
  which will take away all cause of complaint, and give thee firm and
  solid strength. And since by my means thou hast already seen the form of
  true blessedness, and known where it is placed, running over all those
  things which I think necessary to rehearse, I will show thee the way
  which will carry thee home. And I will also fasten wings upon thy mind,
  with which she may rouse herself, that, all perturbation being driven
  away, thou mayest return safely into thy country by my direction, by my
  path, and with my wings.</p>

dubitas?" "Ne hoc quidem," inquam. "Si quis igitur pedibus incedere ualens
ambulet aliusque cui hoc naturale pedum desit officium, manibus nitens
ambulare conetur, quis horum iure ualentior existimari potest?" "Contexe,"
inquam, "cetera; nam quin naturalis officii potens eo qui idem nequeat
ualentior sit, nullus ambigat." "Sed summum bonum, quod aeque malis
bonisque propositum, boni quidem naturali officio uirtutum petunt, mali
uero uariam per cupiditatem, quod adipiscendi boni naturale officium non
est, idem ipsum conantur adipisci. An tu aliter existimas?"  "Minime,"
inquam, "nam etiam quod est consequens patet. Ex his enim quae concesserim,
bonos quidem potentes, malos uero esse necesse est imbecillos."</p>

<p id="id00759">"Recte," inquit, "praecurris idque, uti medici sperare solent, indicium est
erectae iam resistentisque naturae. Sed quoniam te ad intellegendum
promptissimum esse conspicio, crebras coaceruabo rationes. Vide enim quanta
uitiosorum hominum pateat infirmitas qui ne ad hoc quidem peruenire queunt
ad quod eos naturalis ducit ac paene compellit intentio. Et quid si hoc tam
magno ac paene inuicto praeeuntis naturae desererentur auxilio? Considera
uero quanta sceleratos homines habeat impotentia. Neque enim leuia aut
ludicra praemia petunt, quae consequi atque obtinere non possunt, sed circa
ipsam rerum summam uerticemque deficiunt nec in eo miseris contingit
effectus quod solum dies noctesque moliuntur; in qua re bonorum uires
eminent. Sicut enim eum qui pedibus incedens ad eum locum usque peruenire
potuisset, quo nihil ulterius peruium iaceret incessui, ambulandi
potentissimum esse censeres, ita eum qui expetendorum finem quo nihil ultra
est apprehendit, potentissimum necesse est iudices. Ex quo fit quod huic
obiacet, ut idem scelesti, idem uiribus omnibus uideantur esse deserti. Cur
enim relicta uirtute uitia sectantur? Inscitiane bonorum? Sed quid
eneruatius ignorantiae caecitate? An sectanda nouerunt? Sed transuersos eos
libido praecipitat. Sic quoque intemperantia fragiles qui obluctari uitio
nequeunt. An scientes uolentesque bonum deserunt, ad uitia deflectunt? Sed
hoc modo non solum potentes esse sed omnino esse desinunt. Nam qui communem
omnium quae sunt finem relinquunt, pariter quoque esse desistunt. Quod
quidem cuipiam mirum forte uideatur, ut malos, qui plures hominum sunt,
eosdem non esse dicamus; sed ita sese res habet. Nam qui mali sunt eos
malos esse non abnuo; sed eosdem esse pure atque simpliciter nego.</p>

<p id="id00760">Nam uti cadauer hominem mortuum dixeris, simpliciter uero hominem appellare
non possis, ita uitiosos malos quidem esse concesserim, sed esse absolute

uero ab hac deficit, esse etiam quod in sua natura situm est derelinquit.
'Sed possunt,' inquies, 'mali.' Ne ego quidem negauerim, sed haec eorum
potentia non a uiribus sed ab imbecillitate descendit. Possunt enim mala
quae minime ualerent, si in bonorum efficientia manere potuissent. Quae
possibilitas eos euidentius nihil posse demonstrat. Nam si, uti paulo ante
collegimus, malum nihil est, cum mala tantummodo possint, nihil posse
improbos liquet." "Perspicuum est." "Atque ut intellegas quaenam sit huius
potentiae uis, summo bono nihil potentius esse paulo ante definiuimus."
"Ita est," inquam. "Sed idem," inquit, "facere malum nequit." "Minime."
"Est igitur," inquit, "aliquis qui omnia posse homines putet?" "Nisi quis
insaniat, nemo." "Atqui idem possunt mala." "Vtinam quidem," inquam, "non
possent." "Cum igitur bonorum tantummodo potens possit omnia, non uero
queant omnia potentes etiam malorum, eosdem qui mala possunt minus posse
manifestum est. Huc accedit quod omnem potentiam inter expetenda numerandam
omniaque expetenda referri ad bonum uelut ad quoddam naturae suae cacumen
ostendimus. Sed patrandi sceleris possibilitas referri ad bonum non potest;
expetenda igitur non est. Atqui omnis potentia expetenda est; liquet igitur
malorum possibilitatem non esse potentiam. Ex quibus omnibus bonorum quidem
potentia, malorum uero minime dubitabilis apparet infirmitas ueramque illam
Platonis esse sententiam liquet solos quod desiderent facere posse
sapientes, improbos uero exercere quidem quod libeat, quod uero desiderent
explere non posse. Faciunt enim quaelibet, dum per ea quibus delectantur id
bonum quod desiderant se adepturos putant; sed minime adipiscuntur, quoniam
ad beatitudinem probra non ueniunt.</p>

<p id="id00762" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "Oh!" quoth I. "How great things dost thou promise! And I doubt not but
  thou canst perform them, wherefore stay me not now that thou hast
  stirred up my desires." "First then," quoth she, "that good men are
  always powerful, and evil men of no strength, thou mayest easily know,
  the one is proved by the other. For since that good and evil are
  contraries, if it be convinced that goodness is potent, the weakness of
  evil will be also manifest; and contrariwise if we discern the frailty
  of evil, we must needs acknowledge the firmness of goodness. But that
  our opinions may be more certainly embraced, I will take both ways,
  confirming my propositions, sometime from one part, sometime from
  another.</p>

<p id="id00763" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  There be two things by which all human actions are effected, will and
  power, of which if either be wanting, there can nothing be performed.
  For if there want will, no man taketh anything in hand against his will,
  and if there be not power, the will is in vain. So that, if thou seest
  any willing to obtain that which he doth not obtain, thou canst not
  doubt but that he wanted power to obtain what he would." "It is
  manifest," quoth I, "and can by no means be denied." "And wilt thou
  doubt that he could, whom thou seest bring to pass what he desired?"
  "No." "But every man is mighty in that which he can do, and weak in that
  which he cannot do." "I confess it," quoth I. "Dost thou remember then,"
  quoth she, "that it was inferred by our former discourses that all the
  intentions of man's will doth hasten to happiness, though their courses
  be divers?" "I remember," quoth I, "that that also was proved." "Dost
  thou also call to mind that blessedness is goodness itself, and
  consequently when blessedness is sought after, goodness must of course
  be desired?" "I call it not to mind, for I have it already fixed in my
  memory." "Wherefore all men both good and bad without difference of
  intentions endeavour to obtain goodness." "It followeth," quoth I. "But
  it is certain that men are made good by the obtaining of goodness." "It
  is so." "Wherefore good men obtain what they desire." "So it seemeth."
  "And if evil men did obtain the goodness they desire, they could not be
  evil." "It is true." "Wherefore since they both desire goodness, but the
  one obtaineth it and the other not, there is no doubt but that good men
  are powerful, and the evil weak." "Whosoever doubteth of this," quoth I,
  "he neither considereth the nature of things, nor the consequence of thy
  reasons." "Again," quoth she, "if there be two to whom the same thing is
  proposed according to nature, and the one of them bringeth it perfectly
  to pass with his natural function, but the other cannot exercise that
  natural function but after another manner than is agreeable to nature,
  and doth not perform that which he had proposed, but imitateth the other
  who performeth it: which of these two wilt thou judge to be more
  powerful?" "Though I conjecture," quoth I, "at thy meaning, yet I desire
  to hear it more plainly." "Wilt thou deny," quoth she, "that the motion
  of walking is agreeable to the nature of men?" "No," quoth I. "And
  makest thou any doubt that the function of it doth naturally belong to
  the feet?" "There is no doubt of this neither," quoth I. "Wherefore if
  one that can go upon his feet doth walk, and another who hath not this
  natural function of his feet endeavoureth to walk by creeping upon his
  hands, which of these two is deservedly to be esteemed the stronger?"
  "Infer the rest," quoth I, "for no man doubteth but that he which can
  use that natural function is stronger than he which cannot." "But,"
  quoth she, "the good seek to obtain the chiefest good, which is equally
  proposed to bad and good, by the natural function of virtues, but the
  evil endeavour to obtain the same by divers concupiscences, which are
  not the natural function of obtaining goodness. Thinkest thou
  otherwise?" "No," quoth I, "for it is manifest what followeth. For by
  the force of that which I have already granted, it is necessary that
  good men are powerful and evil men weak."</p>

<p id="id00764" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "Thou runnest before rightly," quoth she, "and it is (as physicians are
  wont to hope) a token of an erected and resisting nature. Wherefore,
  since I see thee most apt and willing to comprehend, I will therefore
  heap up many reasons together. For consider the great weakness of
  vicious men, who cannot come so far as their natural intention leadeth
  and almost compelleth them. And what if they were destitute of this so
  great and almost invincible help of the direction of nature? Ponder
  likewise the immense impotency of wicked men. For they are no light or
  trifling rewards[145] which they desire, and cannot obtain: but they
  fail in the very sum and top of things: neither can the poor wretches
  compass that which they only labour for nights and days: in which thing
  the forces of the good eminently appear. For as thou wouldst judge him
  to be most able to walk who going on foot could come as far as there
  were any place to go in: so must thou of force judge him most powerful
  who obtaineth the end of all that can be desired, beyond which there is
  nothing. Hence that which is opposite also followeth, that the same men
  are wicked and destitute of all forces. For why do they follow vices,
  forsaking virtues? By ignorance of that which is good? But what is more
  devoid of strength than blind ignorance? Or do they know what they
  should embrace, but passion driveth them headlong the contrary way? So
  also intemperance makes them frail, since they cannot strive against
  vice. Or do they wittingly and willingly forsake goodness, and decline
  to vices? But in this sort they leave not only to be powerful, but even
  to be at all. For they which leave the common end of all things which
  are, leave also being. Which may perhaps seem strange to some, that we
  should say that evil men are not at all, who are the greatest part of
  men: but yet it is so. For I deny not that evil men are evil, but withal
  I say that purely and simply they are not.</p>

<p id="id00765" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  For as thou mayest call a carcase a dead man, but not simply a man, so I
  confess that the vicious are evil, but I cannot grant that they are
  absolutely. For that is which retaineth order, and keepeth nature, but
  that which faileth from this leaveth also to be that which is in his own
  nature. But thou wilt say that evil men can do many things, neither will
  I deny it, but this their power proceedeth not from forces but from
  weakness. For they can do evil, which they could not do if they could
  have remained in the performance of that which is good. Which
  possibility declareth more evidently that they can do nothing. For if,
  as we concluded a little before, evil is nothing, since they can only do
  evil, it is manifest that the wicked can do nothing." "It is most
  manifest." "And that thou mayest understand what the force of this power
  is; we determined a little before that there is nothing more powerful
  than the Sovereign Goodness." "It is true," quoth I. "But He cannot do
  evil." "No." "Is there any then," quoth she, "that think that men can do
  all things?" "No man, except he be mad, thinketh so." "But yet men can
  do evil." "I would to God they could not," quoth I. "Since therefore he
  that can only do good, can do all things, and they who can do evil,
  cannot do all things, it is manifest that they which can do evil are
  less potent. Moreover, we have proved that all power is to be accounted
  among those things which are to be wished for, and that all such things
  have reference to goodness, as to the very height of their nature. But
  the possibility of committing wickedness cannot have reference to
  goodness. Wherefore it is not to be wished for. Yet all power is to be
  wished for; and consequently it is manifest, possibility of evil is no
  power. By all which the power of the good and the undoubted infirmity of
  evil appeareth. And it is manifest that the sentence of Plato is true:
  that only wise men can do that which they desire, and that the wicked
  men practise indeed what they list, but cannot perform what they would.
  For they do what they list, thinking to obtain the good which they
  desire by those things which cause them delight; but they obtain it not,
  because shameful action cannot arrive to happiness.[146]</p>

unaquaeque res geritur, eiusdem rei praemium esse non iniuria uideri
potest, uti currendi in stadio propter quam curritur iacet praemium corona.
Sed beatitudinem esse idem ipsum bonum propter quod omnia geruntur
ostendimus. Est igitur humanis actibus ipsum bonum ueluti praemium commune
propositum. Atqui hoc a bonis non potest separari neque enim bonus ultra
iure uocabitur qui careat bono; quare probos mores sua praemia non
relinquunt. Quantumlibet igitur saeuiant mali, sapienti tamen corona non
decidet, non arescet. Neque enim probis animis proprium decus aliena
decerpit improbitas. Quod si extrinsecus accepto laetaretur, poterat hoc
uel alius quispiam uel ipse etiam qui contulisset auferre; sed quoniam id
sua cuique probitas confert, tum suo praemio carebit, cum probus esse
desierit. Postremo cum omne praemium idcirco appetatur quoniam bonum esse
creditur, quis boni compotem praemii iudicet expertem? At cuius praemii?
Omnium pulcherrimi maximique. Memento etenim corollarii illius quod paulo

nullius minuat potestas, nullius fuscet improbitas, deos fieri. Quae cum
ita sint, de malorum quoque inseparabili poena dubitare sapiens nequeat.
Nam cum bonum malumque item poenae atque praemium aduersa fronte
dissideant, quae in boni praemio uidemus accedere eadem necesse est in mali
poena contraria parte respondeant. Sicut igitur probis probitas ipsa fit
praemium, ita improbis nequitia ipsa supplicium est. Iam uero quisquis
afficitur poena, malo se affectum esse non dubitat. Si igitur sese ipsi
aestimare uelint, possuntne sibi supplicii expertes uideri quos omnium

Vide autem ex aduersa parte bonorum, quae improbos poena comitetur. Omne
namque quod sit unum esse ipsumque unum bonum esse paulo ante didicisti,
cui consequens est ut omne quod sit id etiam bonum esse uideatur. Hoc
igitur modo quidquid a bono deficit esse desistit; quo fit ut mali desinant

Sed cum ultra homines quemque prouehere sola probitas possit, necesse est

<h2 id="id00775" style="margin-top: 4em">  III.</h2>

<p id="id00776" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Seest thou then in what mire wickedness wallows, and how clearly honesty
  shineth? By which it is manifest that the good are never without
  rewards, nor the evil without punishments. For in all things that are
  done that for which anything is done may deservedly seem the reward of
  that action, as to him that runneth a race, the crown for which he
  runneth is proposed as a reward. But we have showed that blessedness is
  the selfsame goodness for which all things are done. Wherefore this
  goodness is proposed as a common reward for all human actions, and this
  cannot be separated from those who are good. For he shall not rightly be
  any longer called good, who wanteth goodness; wherefore virtuous manners
  are not left without their due rewards. And how much so ever the evil do
  rage, yet the wise man's crown will not fade nor wither.  For others'
  wickedness depriveth not virtuous minds of their proper glory. But if he
  should rejoice at anything which he hath from others, either he who gave
  it, or any other might take it away. But because every man's virtue is
  the cause of it, then only he shall want his reward when he leaveth to
  be virtuous. Lastly, since every reward is therefore desired because it
  is thought to be good, who can judge him to be devoid of reward, which
  hath goodness for his possession?  But what reward hath he? The most
  beautiful and the greatest that can be. For remember that
  <i>corollarium</i> [147] which I presented thee with a little before, as
  with a rare and precious jewel, and infer thus: Since that goodness
  itself is happiness, it is manifest that all good men even by being good
  are made happy.  But we agreed that happy men are gods. Wherefore the
  reward of good men, which no time can waste, no man's power diminish, no
  man's wickedness obscure, is to become gods. Which things being so, no
  wise man can any way doubt of the inseparable punishment of the evil.
  For since goodness and evil, punishment and reward, are opposite the one
  to the other, those things which we see fall out in the reward of
  goodness must needs be answerable in a contrary manner in the punishment
  of evil. Wherefore as to honest men honesty itself is a reward, so to
  the wicked their very wickedness is a punishment. And he that is
  punished doubteth not but that he is afflicted with the evil. Wherefore
  if they would truly consider their own estate, can they think themselves
  free from punishment, whom wickedness, the worst of all evils, doth not
  only touch but strongly infect? But weigh the punishment which
  accompanieth the wicked, by comparing it to the reward of the virtuous.
  For thou learnedst not long before that whatsoever is at all is one, and
  that unity is goodness, by which it followeth that whatsoever is must
  also be good. And in this manner, whatsoever falleth from goodness
  ceaseth to be, by which it followeth that evil men leave to be that
  which they were, but the shape of men, which they still retain, showeth
  them to have been men: wherefore by embracing wickedness they have lost
  the nature of men. But since virtue alone can exalt us above men,
  wickedness must needs cast those under the desert of men, which it hath
  bereaved of that condition. Wherefore thou canst not account him a man
  whom thou seest transformed by vices. Is the violent extorter of other
  men's goods carried away with his covetous desire? Thou mayest liken him
  to a wolf. Is the angry and unquiet man always contending and brawling?
  Thou mayest compare him to a dog. Doth the treacherous fellow rejoice
  that he hath deceived others with his hidden frauds? Let him be
  accounted no better than a fox. Doth the outrageous fret and fume? Let
  him be thought to have a lion's mind. Is the fearful and timorous afraid
  without cause? Let him be esteemed like to hares and deer. Is the slow
  and stupid always idle? He liveth an ass's life. Doth the light and
  unconstant change his courses? He is nothing different from the birds.
  Is he drowned in filthy and unclean lusts? He is entangled in the
  pleasure of a stinking sow. So that he who, leaving virtue, ceaseth to
  be a man, since he cannot be partaker of the divine condition, is turned
  into a beast.</p>

<p id="id00786">Tum ego: "Fateor," inquam, "nec iniuria dici uideo uitiosos, tametsi humani
corporis speciem seruent, in beluas tamen animorum qualitate mutari; sed
quorum atrox scelerataque mens bonorum pernicie saeuit, id ipsum eis licere
noluissem." "Nec licet," inquit, "uti conuenienti monstrabitur loco. Sed
tamen si id ipsum quod eis licere creditur auferatur, magna ex parte
sceleratorum hominum poena releuetur. Etenim quod incredibile cuiquam forte
uideatur, infeliciores esse necesse est malos, cum cupita perfecerint, quam
si ea quae cupiunt implere non possint. Nam si miserum est uoluisse praua,
potuisse miserius est, sine quo uoluntatis miserae langueret effectus.
Itaque cum sua singulis miseria sit, triplici infortunio necesse est
urgeantur quos uideas scelus uelle, posse, perficere." "Accedo," inquam,
"sed uti hoc infortunio cito careant patrandi sceleris possibilitate
deserti uehementer exopto." "Carebunt," inquit, "ocius quam uel tu forsitan
uelis uel illi sese aestiment esse carituros. Neque enim est aliquid in tam
breuibus uitae metis ita serum quod exspectare longum immortalis praesertim
animus putet: quorum magna spes et excelsa facinorum machina repentino
atque insperato saepe fine destruitur, quod quidem illis miseriae modum
statuit.</p>

<p id="id00787">Nam si nequitia miseros facit, miserior sit necesse est diuturnior nequam;
quos infelicissimos esse iudicarem, si non eorum malitiam saltem mors
extrema finiret. Etenim si de prauitatis infortunio uera conclusimus,
infinitam liquet esse miseriam quam esse constat aeternam." Tum ego: "Mira
quidem," inquam, "et concessu difficilis inlatio, sed his eam quae prius
concessa sunt nimium conuenire cognosco." "Recte," inquit, "aestimas. Sed
qui conclusioni accedere durum putat, aequum est uel falsum aliquid
praecessisse demonstret uel collocationem propositionum non esse efficacem
necessariae conclusionis ostendat; alioquin concessis praecedentibus nihil
prorsus est quod de inlatione causetur. Nam hoc quoque quod dicam non minus
mirum uideatur, sed ex his quae sumpta sunt aeque est necessarium."
"Quidnam?" inquam. "Feliciores," inquit, "esse improbos supplicia luentes
quam si eos nulla iustitiae poena coerceat. Neque id nunc molior quod
cuiuis ueniat in mentem, corrigi ultione prauos mores et ad rectum
supplicii terrore deduci, ceteris quoque exemplum esse culpanda fugiendi,
sed alio quodam modo infeliciores esse improbos arbitror impunitos, tametsi
nulla ratio correctionis, nullus respectus habeatur exempli." "Et quis
erit," inquam, "praeter hos alius modus?" Et illa: "Bonos," inquit, "esse
felices, malos uero miseros nonne concessimus?" "Ita est," inquam. "Si
igitur," inquit, "miseriae cuiuspiam bonum aliquid addatur, nonne felicior
est eo cuius pura ac solitaria sine cuiusquam boni admixtione miseria est?"
"Sic," inquam, "uidetur." "Quid si eidem misero qui cunctis careat bonis,
praeter ea quibus miser est malum aliud fuerit adnexum, nonne multo
infelicior eo censendus est cuius infortunium boni participatione
releuatur?" "Quidni?" inquam. "Sed puniri improbos iustum, impunitos uero
elabi iniquum esse manifestum est." "Quis id neget?" "Sed ne illud quidem,"
ait, "quisquam negabit bonum esse omne quod iustum est contraque quod
iniustum est malum." Liquere, respondi.[151] "Habent igitur improbi, cum
puniuntur, quidem boni aliquid adnexum poenam ipsam scilicet quae ratione
iustitiae bona est, idemque cum supplicio carent, inest eis aliquid
ulterius mali ipsa impunitas quam iniquitatis merito malum esse confessus
es." "Negare non possum." "Multo igitur infeliciores improbi sunt iniusta
impunitate donati quam iusta ultione puniti." Tum ego: "Ista quidem
consequentia sunt eis quae paulo ante conclusa sunt.</p>

<p id="id00788">Sed quaeso," inquam, "te, nullane animarum supplicia post defunctum morte
corpus relinquis?" "Et magna quidem," inquit, "quorum alia poenali
acerbitate, alia uero purgatoria clementia exerceri puto. Sed nunc de his
disserere consilium non est. Id uero hactenus egimus, ut quae indignissima
tibi uidebatur malorum potestas eam nullam esse cognosceres quosque
impunitos querebare, uideres numquam improbitatis suae carere suppliciis,
licentiam quam cito finiri precabaris nec longam esse disceres
infelicioremque fore, si diuturnior, infelicissimam uero, si esset aeterna;
post haec miseriores esse improbos iniusta impunitate dimissos quam iusta
ultione punitos. Cui sententiae consequens est ut tum demum grauioribus
suppliciis urgeantur, cum impuniti esse creduntur."</p>

<p id="id00789">Tum ego: "Cum tuas," inquam, "rationes considero, nihil dici uerius puto.
At si ad hominum iudicia reuertar, quis ille est cui haec non credenda modo
sed saltem audienda uideantur?" "Ita est," inquit illa. "Nequeunt enim
oculos tenebris assuetos ad lucem perspicuae ueritatis attollere,
similesque auibus sunt quarum intuitum nox inluminat dies caecat. Dum enim
non rerum ordinem, sed suos intuentur affectus, uel licentiam uel
impunitatem scelerum putant esse felicem. Vide autem quid aeterna lex
sanciat. Melioribus animum conformaueris, nihil opus est iudice praemium
deferente tu te ipse excellentioribus addidisti. Studium ad peiora
deflexeris, extra ne quaesieris ultorem. Tu te ipse in deteriora trusisti,
ueluti si uicibus sordidam humum caelumque respicias, cunctis extra
cessantibus ipsa cernendi ratione nunc caeno nunc sideribus interesse
uidearis. At uulgus ista non respicit. Quid igitur? Hisne accedamus quos
beluis similes esse monstrauimus? Quid si quis amisso penitus uisu ipsum
etiam se habuisse obliuisceretur intuitum nihilque sibi ad humanam
perfectionem deesse arbitraretur, num uidentes eadem caecos putaremus? Nam
ne illud quidem adquiescent quod aeque ualidis rationum nititur
firmamentis: infeliciores eos esse qui faciant quam qui patiantur
iniuriam." "Vellem," inquam, "has ipsas audire rationes." "Omnem," inquit,
"improbum num supplicio dignum negas?" "Minime." "Infelices uero esse qui
sint improbi multipliciter liquet." "Ita," inquam. "Qui igitur supplicio
digni sunt miseros esse non dubitas?" "Conuenit," inquam. "Si igitur
cognitor," ait, "resideres, cui supplicium inferendum putares, eine qui
fecisset an qui pertulisset iniuriam?" "Nec ambigo," inquam, "quin perpesso
satisfacerem dolore facientis." "Miserior igitur tibi iniuriae inlator quam
acceptor esse uideretur." "Consequitur," inquam. "Hinc igitur aliis de
causis ea radice nitentibus, quod turpitudo suapte natura miseros faciat,
apparet inlatam cuilibet iniuriam non accipientis sed inferentis esse
miseriam." "Atqui nunc," ait, "contra faciunt oratores. Pro his enim qui
graue quid acerbumque perpessi sunt miserationem iudicum excitare conantur,
cum magis admittentibus iustior miseratio debeatur; quos non ab iratis sed
a propitiis potius miserantibusque accusatoribus ad iudicium ueluti aegros
ad medicum duci oportebat, ut culpae morbos supplicio resecarent. Quo pacto
defensorum opera uel tota frigeret, uel si prodesse hominibus mallet, in
accusationis habitum uerteretur, Ipsi quoque improbi, si eis aliqua rimula
uirtutem relictam fas esset aspicere uitiorumque sordes poenarum
cruciatibus se deposituros uiderent compensatione adipiscendae probitatis,
nec hos cruciatus esse ducerent defensorumque operam repudiarent ac se
totos accusatoribus iudicibusque permitterent. Quo fit ut apud sapientes
nullus prorsus odio locus relinquatur. Nam bonos quis nisi stultissimus
oderit? Malos uero odisse ratione caret. Nam si, uti corporum languor, ita
uitiositas quidam est quasi morbus animorum, cum aegros corpore minime
dignos odio sed potius miseratione iudicemus, multo magis non insequendi
sed miserandi sunt quorum mentes omni languore atrocior urget improbitas.</p>

<p id="id00792" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Then said I, "I confess and perceive that thou affirmest not without
  cause that the vicious, though they keep the outward shape of men, are
  in their inward state of mind changed into brute beasts. But I would
  have had them whose cruel and wicked heart rageth to the harm of the
  good, restrained from executing their malice." "They are restrained,"
  quoth she, "as shall be proved in convenient place. But yet if this
  liberty which they seem to have be taken away, their punishment also is
  in great part released. For (which perhaps to some may seem incredible)
  evil men must necessarily be more unhappy when they have brought to pass
  their purposes than if they could not obtain what they desire. For if it
  be a miserable thing to desire that which is evil, it is more miserable
  to be able to perform it, without which the miserable will could not
  have any effect. Wherefore since everyone of these hath their peculiar
  misery, they must of force be oppressed with a threefold wretchedness,
  whom thou seest desire, be able, and perform wickedness." "I grant it,"
  quoth I, "but earnestly wish that they may soon be delivered from this
  misery, having lost the power to perform their malice." "They will lose
  it," quoth she, "sooner than perhaps either thou wouldst, or they
  themselves suppose. For in the short compass of this life there is
  nothing so late that any one, least of all an immortal soul, should
  think it long in coming; so that the great hope and highest attempts of
  the wicked are many times made frustrate with a sudden and unexpected
  end, which in truth setteth some end to their misery.</p>

<p id="id00793" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  For if wickedness make men miserable, the longer one is wicked, the more
  miserable he must needs be; and I should judge them the most unhappy men
  that may be, if death at least did not end their malice. For if we have
  concluded truly of the misery of wickedness, it is manifest that the
  wretchedness which is everlasting must of force be infinite." "A strange
  illation," quoth I, "and hard to be granted; but I see that those things
  which were granted before agree very well with these." "Thou thinkest
  aright," quoth she, "but he that findeth difficulty to yield to the
  conclusion must either show that something which is presupposed is
  false, or that the combination of the propositions makes not a necessary
  conclusion; otherwise, granting that which went before, he hath no
  reason to doubt of the inference. For this also which I will conclude
  now will seem no less strange, and yet followeth as necessarily out of
  those things which are already assumed." "What?" quoth I. "That wicked
  men," quoth she, "are more happy being punished than if they escaped the
  hands of justice. Neither do I now go about to show that which may come
  into every man's mind, that evil customs are corrected by chastisement,
  and are reduced to virtue by the terror of punishment, and that others
  may take example to avoid evil, but in another manner also I think
  vicious men that go unpunished to be more miserable, although we take no
  account of correction and pay no regard to example." "And what other
  manner shall this be," quoth I, "besides these?" "Have we not granted,"
  quoth she, "that the good are happy, and the evil miserable?" "We have,"
  quoth I. "If then," quoth she, "something that is good be added to one's
  misery, is he not happier than another whose misery is desolate and
  solitary, without any participation of goodness?" "So it seemeth," quoth
  I. "What if there be some other evil annexed to this miserable man who
  is deprived of all goodness, besides those which make him miserable, is
  he not to be accounted much more unhappy than he whose misery is
  lightened by partaking of goodness?" "Why not?" quoth I. "But it is
  manifest that it is just that the wicked be punished, and unjust that
  they should go unpunished." "Who can deny that?" "But neither will any
  man deny this," quoth she, "that whatsoever is just, is good, and
  contrariwise, that whatsoever is unjust, is evil." "Certainly," I
  answered. "Then the wicked have some good annexed when they are
  punished, to wit, the punishment itself, which by reason of justice is
  good, and when they are not punished, they have a further evil, the very
  impunity which thou hast deservedly granted to be an evil because of its
  injustice." "I cannot deny it." "Wherefore the vicious are far more
  unhappy by escaping punishment unjustly, than by being justly punished."
  "This followeth," quoth I, "out of that which hath been concluded
  before.</p>

<p id="id00794" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But I pray thee, leavest thou no punishments for the souls after the
  death of the body?" "And those great too," quoth she. "Some of which I
  think to be executed as sharp punishments, and others as merciful
  purgations.[152] But I purpose not now to treat of those. But we have
  hitherto laboured that thou shouldest perceive the power of the wicked,
  which to thee seemed intolerable, to be none at all, and that thou
  shouldest see, that those whom thou complainedst went unpunished, do
  never escape without punishment for their wickedness. And that thou
  shouldest learn that the licence which thou wishedst might soon end, is
  not long, and yet the longer the more miserable, and most unhappy if it
  were everlasting. Besides, that the wicked are more wretched being
  permitted to escape with unjust impunity, than being punished with just
  severity. Out of which it followeth that they are then more grievously
  punished, when they are thought to go scot-free."</p>

<p id="id00795" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "When I consider thy reasons," quoth I, "I think nothing can be said
  more truly. But if I return to the judgments of men, who is there that
  will think them worthy to be believed or so much as heard?" "It is
  true," quoth she, "for they cannot lift up their eyes accustomed to
  darkness, to behold the light of manifest truth, and they are like those
  birds whose sight is quickened by the night, and dimmed by the day. For
  while they look upon, not the order of things, but their own affections,
  they think that licence and impunity to sin is happy. But see what the
  eternal law establisheth. If thou apply thy mind to the better, thou
  needest no judge to reward thee: thou hast joined thyself to the more
  excellent things. If thou declinest to that which is worse, never expect
  any other to punish thee: thou hast put thyself in a miserable estate;
  as if by turns thou lookest down to the miry ground, and up to heaven,
  setting aside all outward causes, by the very law of sight thou seemest
  sometime to be in the dirt, and sometime present to the stars. But the
  common sort considereth not these things. What then? Shall we join
  ourselves to them whom we have proved to be like beasts? What if one
  having altogether lost his sight should likewise forget that he ever had
  any, and should think that he wanted nothing which belongeth to human
  perfection: should we likewise think them blind, that see as well as
  they saw before? For they will not grant that neither, which may be
  proved by as forcible reasons, that they are more unhappy that do injury
  than they which suffer it." "I would," quoth I, "hear these reasons."
  "Deniest thou," quoth she, "that every wicked man deserveth punishment?"
  "No." "And it is many ways clear that the vicious are miserable?" "Yes,"
  quoth I. "Then you do not doubt that those who deserve punishment are
  wretched?" "It is true," quoth I. "If then," quoth she, "thou wert to
  examine this cause, whom wouldest thou appoint to be punished, him that
  did or that suffered wrong?" "I doubt not," quoth I, "but that I would
  satisfy him that suffered with the sorrow of him that did it." "The
  offerer of the injury then would seem to thee more miserable than the
  receiver?" "It followeth," quoth I. "Hence therefore, and for other
  causes grounded upon that principle that dishonesty of itself maketh men
  miserable, it appeareth that the injury which is offered any man is not
  the receiver's but the doer's misery." "But now-a-days," quoth she,
  "orators take the contrary course. For they endeavour to draw the judges
  to commiseration of them who have suffered any grievous afflictions;
  whereas pity is more justly due to the causers thereof, who should be
  brought, not by angry, but rather by favourable and compassionate
  accusers to judgment, as it were sick men to a physician, that their
  diseases and faults might be taken away by punishments; by which means
  the defenders' labour would either wholly cease, or if they had rather
  do their clients some good, they would change their defence into
  accusations. And the wicked themselves, if they could behold virtue
  abandoned by them, through some little rift, and perceive that they
  might be delivered from the filth of sin by the affliction of
  punishments, obtaining virtue in exchange, they would not esteem of
  torments, and would refuse the assistance of their defenders, and wholly
  resign themselves to their accusers and judges. By which means it cometh
  to pass, that in wise men there is no place for hatred. For who but a
  very fool would hate the good? And to hate the wicked were against
  reason. For as faintness is a disease of the body, so is vice a sickness
  of the mind. Wherefore, since we judge those that have corporal
  infirmities to be rather worthy of compassion than of hatred, much more
  are they to be pitied, and not abhorred, whose minds are oppressed with
  wickedness, the greatest malady that may be.</p>
