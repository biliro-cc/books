<p id="id00154" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But since no relation can be affirmed of one subject alone, since a
  predication referring to one substance is a predication without
  relation, the manifoldness of the Trinity is secured through the
  category of relation, and the Unity is maintained through the fact that
  there is no difference of substance, or operation, or generally of any
  substantial predicate. So then, the category of substance preserves the
  Unity, that of relation brings about the Trinity. Hence only terms
  belonging to relation may be applied singly to Each. For the Father is
  not the same as the Son, nor is either of Them the same as the Holy
  Spirit. Yet Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each the same God, the same
  in justice, in goodness, in greatness, and in everything that can be
  predicated of substance. One must not forget that predicates of
  relativity do not always involve relation to something other than the
  subject, as slave involves master, where the two terms are different.
  For equals are equal, like are like, identicals are identical, each with
  other, and the relation of Father to Son, and of both to Holy Spirit is
  a relation of identicals. A relation of this kind is not to be found in
  created things, but that is because of the difference which we know
  attaches to transient objects. We must not in speaking of God let
  imagination lead us astray; we must let the Faculty of pure Knowledge
  lift us up and teach us to know all things as far as they may be
  known.[26]</p>

  my reasoning awaits the standard of your judgment; your authority will

  helping me, I have furnished some support in argument to an article
  which stands by itself on the firm foundation of Faith, I shall render
  joyous praise for the finished work to Him from whom the invitation

<p id="id00160">Quaero an pater et filius ac spiritus sanctus de diuinitate substantialiter
praedicentur an alio quolibet modo; uiamque indaginis hinc arbitror esse
sumendam, unde rerum omnium manifestum constat exordium, id est ab ipsis
catholicae fidei fundamentis. Si igitur interrogem, an qui dicitur pater
substantia sit, respondetur esse substantia. Quod si quaeram, an filius
substantia sit, idem dicitur. Spiritum quoque sanctum substantiam esse nemo
dubitauerit. Sed cum rursus colligo patrem filium spiritum sanctum, non
plures sed una occurrit esse substantia. Vna igitur substantia trium nec
separari ullo modo aut disiungi potest nec uelut partibus in unum coniuncta
est, sed est una simpliciter. Quaecumque igitur de diuina substantia
praedicantur, ea tribus oportet esse communia; idque signi erit quae sint
quae de diuinitatis substantia praedicentur, quod quaecumque hoc modo
dicuntur, de singulis in unum collectis tribus singulariter praedicabuntur.
Hoc modo si dicimus: "Pater deus est, filius deus est, spiritus sanctus
deus est," pater filius ac spiritus sanctus unus deus. Si igitur eorum una
deitas una substantia est, licet dei nomen de diuinitate substantialiter
praedicari.</p>

<p id="id00161">Ita pater ueritas est, filius ueritas est, spiritus sanctus ueritas est;
pater filius et spiritus sanctus non tres ueritates sed una ueritas est. Si
igitur una in his substantia una est ueritas, necesse est ueritatem
substantialiter praedicari. De bonitate de incommutabilitate de iustitia de
omnipotentia ac de ceteris omnibus quae tam de singulis quam de omnibus
singulariter praedicamus manifestum est substantialiter dici. Vnde apparet
ea quae cum in singulis separatim dici conuenit nec tamen in omnibus dici
queunt, non substantialiter praedicari sed alio modo; qui uero iste sit,
posterius quaeram. Nam qui pater est, hoc uocabulum non transmittit ad
filium neque ad spiritum sanctum. Quo fit ut non sit substantiale nomen hoc
inditum; nam si substantiale esset, ut deus ut ueritas ut iustitia ut ipsa
quoque substantia, de ceteris diceretur.</p>

<p id="id00162">Item filius solus hoc recipit nomen neque cum aliis iungit sicut in deo,
sicut in ueritate, sicut in ceteris quae superius dixi. Spiritus quoque non
est idem qui pater ac filius. Ex his igitur intellegimus patrem ac filium
ac spiritum sanctum non de ipsa diuinitate substantialiter dici sed alio
quodam modo; si enim substantialiter praedicaretur, et de singulis et de
omnibus singulariter diceretur. Haec uero ad aliquid dici manifestum est;
nam et pater alicuius pater est et filius alicuius filius est, spiritus
alicuius spiritus. Quo fit, ut ne trinitas quidem substantialiter de deo
praedicetur; non enim pater trinitas (qui enim pater est, filius ac
spiritus sanctus non est) nec trinitas filius nec trinitas spiritus sanctus
secundum eundem modum, sed trinitas quidem in personarum pluralitate
consistit, unitas uero in substantiae simplicitate.</p>

<p id="id00163">Quod si personae diuisae sunt, substantia uero indiuisa sit, necesse est
quod uocabulum ex personis originem capit id ad substantiam non pertinere;
at trinitatem personarum diuersitas fecit, trinitas igitur non pertinet ad
substantiam. Quo fit ut neque pater neque filius neque spiritus sanctus
neque trinitas de deo substantialiter praedicetur, sed ut dictum est ad
aliquid. Deus uero ueritas iustitia bonitas omnipotentia substantia
inmutabilitas uirtus sapientia et quicquid huiusmodi excogitari potest
substantialiter de diuinitate dicuntur. Haec si se recte et ex fide habent,
ut me instruas peto; aut si aliqua re forte diuersus es, diligentius
intuere quae dicta sunt et fidem si poterit rationemque coniunge.</p>

<h5 id="id00165">  MOST HONOURABLE, OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER OF EX-CONSULS, PATRICIAN</h5>

<h5 id="id00166">  TO JOHN THE DEACON</h5>

<h5 id="id00167">  WHETHER FATHER, SON, AND HOLY SPIRIT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY PREDICATED OF
  THE DIVINITY</h5>

<p id="id00168" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The question before us is whether Father, Son, and Holy Spirit may be
  predicated of the Divinity substantially or otherwise. And I think that
  the method of our inquiry must be borrowed from what is admittedly the
  surest source of all truth, namely, the fundamental doctrines of the
  catholic faith. If, then, I ask whether He who is called Father is a
  substance, the answer will be yes. If I ask whether the Son is a
  substance, the reply will be the same. So, too, no one will hesitate to
  affirm that the Holy Spirit is also a substance. But when, on the other
  hand, I take together all three, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the
  result is not three substances but one substance. The one substance of
  the Three, then, cannot be separated or divided, nor is it made up of
  various parts, combined into one: it is simply one. Everything,
  therefore, that is affirmed of the divine substance must be common to
  the Three, and we can recognize what predicates may be affirmed of the
  substance of the godhead by this sign, that all those which are affirmed
  of it may also be affirmed severally of each of the Three combined into
  one. For instance if we say "the Father is God, the Son is God, and the
  Holy Spirit is God," then Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God. If
  then their one godhead is one substance, the name of God may with right
  be predicated substantially of the Divinity.</p>

<p id="id00169" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Similarly the Father is truth, the Son is truth, and the Holy Spirit is
  truth; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not three truths, but one truth.
  If, then, they are one substance and one truth, truth must of necessity
  be a substantial predicate. So Goodness, Immutability, Justice,
  Omnipotence and all the other predicates which we apply to the Persons
  singly and collectively are plainly substantial predicates. Hence it
  appears that what may be predicated of each single One but not of all
  Three is not a substantial predicate, but of another kind—of what kind
  I will examine presently. For He who is Father does not transmit this
  name to the Son nor to the Holy Spirit. Hence it follows that this name
  is not attached to Him as something substantial; for if it were a
  substantial predicate, as God, truth, justice, or substance itself, it
  would be affirmed of the other Persons.</p>

<p id="id00170" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Similarly the Son alone receives this name; nor does He associate it
  with the other Persons, as in the case of the titles God, truth, and the
  other predicates which I have already mentioned. The Spirit too is not
  the same as the Father and the Son. Hence we gather that Father, Son,
  and Holy Spirit are not predicated of the Divinity in a substantial
  manner, but otherwise.[27] For if each term were predicated
  substantially it would be affirmed of the three Persons both separately
  and collectively. It is evident that these terms are relative, for the
  Father is some one's Father, the Son is some one's Son, the Spirit is
  some one's Spirit. Hence not even Trinity may be substantially[28]
  predicated of God; for the Father is not Trinity—since He who is Father
  is not Son and Holy Spirit—nor yet, by parity of reasoning, is the Son
  Trinity nor the Holy Spirit Trinity, but the Trinity consists in
  diversity of Persons, the Unity in simplicity of substance.</p>

<p id="id00171" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Now if the Persons are separate, while the Substance is undivided, it
  must needs be that that term which is derived from Persons does not
  belong to Substance. But the Trinity is effected by diversity of
  Persons, wherefore Trinity does not belong to Substance. Hence neither
  Father, nor Son, nor Holy Spirit, nor Trinity can be substantially
  predicated of God, but only relatively, as we have said. But God, Truth,
  Justice, Goodness, Omnipotence, Substance, Immutability, Virtue, Wisdom
  and all other conceivable predicates of the kind are applicable
  substantially to divinity.</p>

<p id="id00172" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  If I am right and speak in accordance with the Faith, I pray you confirm
  me. But if you are in any point of another opinion, examine carefully
  what I have said, and if possible, reconcile faith and reason.[29]</p>

<p id="id00189">Quaestio uero huiusmodi est. Ea quae sunt bona sunt; tenet enim communis
sententia doctorum omne quod est ad bonum tendere, omne autem tendit ad
simile. Quae igitur ad bonum tendunt bona ipsa sunt. Sed quemadmodum bona
sint, inquirendum est, utrumne participatione an substantia? Si
participatione, per se ipsa nullo modo bona sunt; nam quod participatione
album est, per se in eo quod ipsum est album non est. Et de ceteris
qualitatibus eodem modo. Si igitur participatione sunt bona, ipsa per se
nullo modo bona sunt: non igitur ad bonum tendunt. Sed concessum est. Non
igitur participatione sunt bona sed substantia. Quorum uero substantia bona
est, id quod sunt bona sunt; id quod sunt autem habent ex eo quod est esse.
Esse igitur ipsorum bonum est; omnium igitur rerum ipsum esse bonum est.
Sed si esse bonum est, ea quae sunt in eo quod sunt bona sunt idemque illis
est esse quod boni esse; substantialia igitur bona sunt, quoniam non
participant bonitatem. Quod si ipsum esse in eis bonum est, non est dubium
quin substantialia cum sint bona, primo sint bono similia ac per hoc hoc
ipsum bonum erunt; nihil enim illi praeter se ipsum simile est. Ex quo fit
ut omnia quae sunt deus sint, quod dictu nefas est. Non sunt igitur
substantialia bona ac per hoc non in his est esse bonum; non sunt igitur in
eo quod sunt bona. Sed nec participant bonitatem; nullo enim modo ad bonum
tenderent. Nullo modo igitur sunt bona.</p>

<p id="id00190">Huic quaestioni talis poterit adhiberi solutio. Multa sunt quae cum
separari actu non possunt, animo tamen et cogitatione separantur; ut cum
triangulum uel cetera a subiecta materia nullus actu separat, mente tamen
segregans ipsum triangulum proprietatemque eius praeter materiam
speculatur. Amoueamus igitur primi boni praesentiam paulisper ex animo,
quod esse quidem constat idque ex omnium doctorum indoctorumque sententia
barbararumque gentium religionibus cognosci potest. Hoc igitur paulisper
amoto ponamus omnia esse quae sunt bona atque ea consideremus quemadmodum
bona esse possent, si a primo bono minime defluxissent. Hinc intueor aliud
in eis esse quod bona sunt, aliud quod sunt. Ponatur enim una eademque
substantia bona esse alba, grauis, rotunda. Tunc aliud esset ipsa illa
substantia, aliud eius rotunditas, aliud color, aliud bonitas; nam si haec
singula idem essent quod ipsa substantia, idem esset grauitas quod color,
quod bonum et bonum quod grauitas—quod fieri natura non sinit. Aliud
igitur tunc in eis esset esse, aliud aliquid esse, ac tunc bona quidem
essent, esse tamen ipsum minime haberent bonum. Igitur si ullo modo essent,
non a bono ac bona essent ac non idem essent quod bona, sed eis aliud esset
esse aliud bonis esse. Quod si nihil omnino aliud essent nisi bona neque
grauia neque colorata neque spatii dimensione distenta nec ulla in eis
qualitas esset, nisi tantum bona essent, tunc non res sed rerum uideretur
esse principium nec potius uiderentur, sed uideretur; unum enim solumque
est huiusmodi, quod tantum bonum aliudque nihil sit. Quae quoniam non sunt
simplicia, nec esse omnino poterant, nisi ea id quod solum bonum est esse
uoluisset. Idcirco quoniam esse eorum a boni uoluntate defluxit, bona esse
dicuntur. Primum enim bonum, quoniam est, in eo quod est bonum est;
secundum uero bonum, quoniam ex eo fluxit cuius ipsum esse bonum est, ipsum
quoque bonum est. Sed ipsum esse omnium rerum ex eo fluxit quod est primum
bonum et quod bonum tale est ut recte dicatur in eo quod est esse bonum.
Ipsum igitur eorum esse bonum est; tunc enim in eo.</p>

<p id="id00191">Qua in re soluta quaestio est. Idcirco enim licet in eo quod sint bona
sint, non sunt tamen similia primo bono, quoniam non quoquo modo sint res
ipsum esse earum bonum est, sed quoniam non potest esse ipsum esse rerum,
nisi a primo esse defluxerit, id est bono; idcirco ipsum esse bonum est nec
est simile ei a quo est. Illud enim quoquo modo sit bonum est in eo quod
est; non enim aliud est praeterquam bonum. Hoc autem nisi ab illo esset,
bonum fortasse esse posset, sed bonum in eo quod est esse non posset. Tunc
enim participaret forsitan bono; ipsum uero esse quod non haberent a bono,
bonum habere non possent. Igitur sublato ab his bono primo mente et
cogitatione, ista licet essent bona, tamen in eo quod essent bona esse non
possent, et quoniam actu non potuere exsistere, nisi illud ea quod uere
bonum est produxisset, idcirco et esse eorum bonum est et non est simile
substantiali bono id quod ab eo fluxit; et nisi ab eo fluxissent, licet
essent bona, tamen in eo quod sunt bona esse non possent, quoniam et
praeter bonum et non ex bono essent, cum illud ipsum bonum primum est et
ipsum esse sit et ipsum bonum et ipsum esse bonum. At non etiam alba in eo
quod sunt alba esse oportebit ea quae alba sunt, quoniam ex uoluntate dei
fluxerunt ut essent, alba minime. Aliud est enim esse, aliud albis esse;
hoc ideo, quoniam qui ea ut essent effecit bonus quidem est, minime uero
albus. Voluntatem igitur boni comitatum est ut essent bona in eo quod sunt;
uoluntatem uero non albi non est comitata talis eius quod est proprietas ut
esset album in eo quod est; neque enim ex albi uoluntate defluxerunt.
Itaque quia uoluit esse ea alba qui erat non albus, sunt alba tantum; quia
uero uoluit ea esse bona qui erat bonus, sunt bona in eo quod sunt.
Secundum hanc igitur rationem cuncta oportet esse iusta, quoniam ipse
iustus est qui ea esse uoluit? Ne hoc quidem. Nam bonum esse essentiam,
iustum uero esse actum respicit. Idem autem est in eo esse quod agere; idem
igitur bonum esse quod iustum. Nobis uero non est idem esse quod agere; non
enim simplices sumus. Non est igitur nobis idem bonis esse quod iustis, sed
idem nobis est esse omnibus in eo quod sumus. Bona igitur omnia sunt, non
etiam iusta. Amplius bonum quidem generale est, iustum uero speciale nec
species descendit in omnia. Idcirco alia quidem iusta alia aliud omnia
bona.</p>

<h5 id="id00195">  HOW SUBSTANCES CAN BE GOOD IN VIRTUE OF THEIR EXISTENCE WITHOUT BEING
  ABSOLUTE GOODS</h5>

<p id="id00196" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  You ask me to state and explain somewhat more clearly that obscure
  question in my <i>Hebdomads</i>[32] concerning the manner in which
  substances can be good in virtue of existence without being absolute
  goods.[33] You urge that this demonstration is necessary because the
  method of this kind of treatise is not clear to all. I can bear witness
  with what eagerness you have already attacked the subject. But I confess
  I like to expound my <i>Hebdomads</i> to myself, and would rather bury
  my speculations in my own memory than share them with any of those pert
  and frivolous persons who will not tolerate an argument unless it is
  made amusing. Wherefore do not you take objection to the obscurity that
  waits on brevity; for obscurity is the sure treasure-house of secret
  doctrine and has the further advantage that it speaks a language
  understood only of those who deserve to understand. I have therefore
  followed the example of the mathematical[34] and cognate sciences and
  laid down bounds and rules according to which I shall develop all that
  follows.</p>

<p id="id00197" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I. A common conception is a statement generally accepted as soon as it
  is made. Of these there are two kinds. One is universally intelligible;
  as, for instance, "if equals be taken from equals the remainders are
  equal." Nobody who grasps that proposition will deny it. The other kind
  is intelligible only to the learned, but it is derived from the same
  class of common conceptions; as "Incorporeals cannot occupy space," and
  the like. This is obvious to the learned but not to the common herd.</p>

<p id="id00198" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  II. Being and a concrete thing[35] are different. Simple Being awaits
  manifestation, but a thing is and exists[36] as soon as it has received
  the form which gives it Being.</p>

<p id="id00199">  III. A concrete thing can participate in something else; but absolute<br/>

  Being can in no wise participate in anything. For participation is<br/>

  effected when a thing already is; but it is something after it has<br/>

  acquired Being.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00200">  IV. That which exists can possess something besides itself. But absolute<br/>

  Being has no admixture of aught besides Itself.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00201">  V. Merely to be something and to be something absolutely are different;<br/>

  the former implies accidents, the latter connotes a substance.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00202" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  VI. Everything that is participates in absolute Being[37] through the
  fact that it exists. In order to be something it participates in
  something else. Hence that which exists participates in absolute Being
  through the fact that it exists, but it exists in order to participate
  in something else.</p>

<p id="id00203">  VII. Every simple thing possesses as a unity its absolute and its<br/>

  particular Being.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00204">  VIII. In every composite thing absolute and individual Being are not one<br/>

  and the same.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00205">  IX. Diversity repels; likeness attracts. That which seeks something<br/>

  outside itself is demonstrably of the same nature as that which it<br/>

  seeks.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00206">  These preliminaries are enough then for our purpose. The intelligent<br/>

  interpreter of the discussion will supply the arguments appropriate to<br/>

  each point.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00207" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Now the problem is this. Things which are, are good. For all the learned
  are agreed that every existing thing tends to good and everything tends
  to its like. Therefore things which tend to good are good. We must,
  however, inquire how they are good—by participation or by substance. If
  by participation, they are in no wise good in themselves; for a thing
  which is white by participation in whiteness is not white in itself by
  virtue of absolute Being. So with all other qualities. If then they are
  good by participation, they are not good in themselves; therefore they
  do not tend to good. But we have agreed that they do. Therefore they are
  good not by participation but by substance. But those things whose
  substance is good are substantially good. But they owe their actual
  Being to absolute Being. Their absolute Being therefore is good;
  therefore the absolute Being of all things is good. But if their Being
  is good, things which exist are good through the fact that they exist
  and their absolute Being is the same as that of the Good. Therefore they
  are substantial goods, since they do not merely participate in goodness.
  But if their absolute Being is good, there is no doubt but that, since
  they are substantial goods, they are like the First Good and therefore
  they will have to be that Good. For nothing is like It save Itself.
  Hence all things that are, are God—an impious assertion. Wherefore
  things are not substantial goods, and so the essence of the Good does
  not reside in them. Therefore they are not good through the fact that
  they exist. But neither do they receive good by participation, for they
  would in no wise tend to good. Therefore they are in no wise good.[38]</p>

<p id="id00208" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  This problem admits of the following solution.[39] There are many things
  which can be separated by a mental process, though they cannot be
  separated in fact. No one, for instance, can actually separate a
  triangle or other mathematical figure from the underlying matter; but
  mentally one can consider a triangle and its properties apart from
  matter. Let us, therefore, remove from our minds for a moment the
  presence of the Prime Good, whose Being is admitted by the universal
  consensus of learned and unlearned opinion and can be deduced from the
  religious beliefs of savage races. The Prime Good having been thus for a
  moment put aside, let us postulate as good all things that are, and let
  us consider how they could possibly be good if they did not derive from
  the Prime Good. This process leads me to perceive that their Goodness
  and their existence are two different things. For let me suppose that
  one and the same substance is good, white, heavy, and round. Then it
  must be admitted that its substance, roundness, colour, and goodness are
  all different things. For if each of these qualities were the same as
  its substance, weight would be the same thing as colour or goodness, and
  goodness would be the same as colour; which is contrary to nature. Their
  Being then in that case would be one thing, their quality another, and
  they would be good, but they would not have their absolute Being good.
  Therefore if they really existed at all, they would not be from good nor
  good, they would not be the same as good, but Being and Goodness would
  be for them two different things. But if they were nothing else but good
  substances, and were neither heavy, nor coloured, and possessed neither
  spatial dimension nor quality, beyond that of goodness, they (or rather
  it) would seem to be not things but the principle of things. For there
  is one thing alone that is by nature good to the exclusion of every
  other quality. But since they are not simple, they could not even exist
  at all unless that which is the one sole Good willed them to be. They
  are called good simply because their Being is derived from the Will of
  the Good. For the Prime Good is essentially good in virtue of Being; the
  secondary good is in its turn good because it derives from the good
  whose absolute Being is good. But the absolute Being of all things
  derives from the Prime Good which is such that of It Being and Goodness
  are rightly predicated as identical. Their absolute Being therefore is
  good; for thereby it resides in Him.</p>

<p id="id00209" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Thereby the problem is solved. For though things be good through the
  fact that they exist, they are not like the Prime Good, for the simple
  reason that their absolute Being is not good under all circumstances,
  but that things can have no absolute Being unless it derive from the
  Prime Being, that is, the Prime Good; their substance, therefore, is
  good, and yet it is not like that from which it comes. For the Prime
  Good is good through the fact that it exists, irrespective of all
  conditions, for it is nothing else than good; but the second good if it
  derived from any other source might be good, but could not be good
  through the fact that it exists. For in that case it might possibly
  participate in good, but their substantial Being, not deriving from the
  Prime Good, could not have the element of good. Therefore when we have
  put out of mind the Prime Good, these things, though they might be good,
  would not be good through the fact that they exist, and since they could
  not actually exist unless the true good had produced them, therefore
  their Being is good, and yet that which springs from the substantial
  Good is not like its source which produces it. And unless they had
  derived from it, though they were good yet they could not be good
  through the fact that they exist because they were apart from good and
  not derived from good, since that very good is the Prime Good and is
  substantial Being and substantial Good and essential Goodness. But we
  need not say that white things are white through the fact that they
  exist; for they drew their existence from the will of God, but not their
  whiteness. For to be is one thing; to be white is another; and that
  because He who gave them Being is good, but not white. It is therefore
  in accordance with the will of the Good that they should be good through
  the fact that they exist; but it is not in accordance with the will of
  one who is not white that a thing have a certain property making it
  white in virtue of its Being; for it was not the will of One who is
  white that gave them Being. And so they are white simply because One who
  was not white willed them to be white; but they are good through the
  fact that they exist because One who was good willed them to be good.
  Ought, then, by parity of reason, all things to be just because He is
  just who willed them to be? That is not so either. For to be good
  involves Being, to be just involves an act. For Him being and action are
  identical; to be good and to be just are one and the same for Him. But
  being and action are not identical for us, for we are not simple. For
  us, then, goodness is not the same thing as justice, but we all have the
  same sort of Being in virtue of our existence. Therefore all things are
  good, but all things are not just. Finally, good is a general, but just
  is a species, and this species does not apply to all. Wherefore some
  things are just, others are something else, but all things are good.</p>

<p id="id00219">Christianam fidem noui ac ueteris testamenti pandit auctoritas; et quamuis
nomen ipsum Christi uetus intra semet continuerit instrumentum eumque
semper signauerit affuturum quem credimus per partum uirginis iam uenisse,
tamen in orbem terrarum ab ipsius nostri saluatoris mirabili manasse
probatur aduentu.</p>

<p id="id00220">Haec autem religio nostra, quae uocatur christiana atque catholica, his
fundamentis principaliter nititur asserens: ex aeterno, id est ante mundi
constitutionem, ante omne uidelicet quod temporis potest retinere
uocabulum, diuinam patris et filii ac spiritus sancti exstitisse
substantiam, ita ut deum dicat patrem, deum filium, deum spiritum sanctum,
nec tamen tres deos sed unum: patrem itaque habere filium ex sua substantia
genitum et sibi nota ratione coaeternum, quem filium eatenus confitetur, ut
non sit idem qui pater est: neque patrem aliquando fuisse filium, ne rursus
in infinitum humanus animus diuinam progeniem cogitaret, neque filium in
eadem natura qua patri coaeternus est aliquando fieri patrem, ne rursus in
infinitum diuina progenies tenderetur: sanctum uero spiritum neque patrem
esse neque filium atque ideo in illa natura nec genitum nec generantem sed
a patre quoque procedentem uel filio; qui sit tamen processionis istius
modus ita non possumus euidenter dicere, quemadmodum generationem filii ex
paterna substantia non potest humanus animus aestimare. Haec autem ut
credantur uetus ac noua informat instructio. De qua uelut arce religionis
nostrae multi diuersa et humaniter atque ut ita dicam carnaliter sentientes
aduersa locuti sunt, ut Arrius qui licet deum dicat filium, minorem tamen
patre multipliciter et extra patris substantiam confitetur. Sabelliani
quoque non tres exsistentes personas sed unam ausi sunt affirmare, eundem
dicentes patrem esse qui filius est eundemque filium qui pater est atque
spiritum sanctum eundem esse qui pater et filius est; ac per hoc unam
dicunt esse personam sub uocabulorum diuersitate signatam.</p>

<p id="id00221">Manichaei quoque qui duo principia sibi coaeterna et aduersa profitentur,
unigenitum dei esse non credunt. Indignum enim iudicant, si deus habere
filium uideatur, nihil aliud cogitantes nisi carnaliter, ut quia haec
generatio duorum corporum commixtione procedit, illic quoque indignum esse
intellectum huiusmodi applicare; quae res eos nec uetus facit recipere
testamentum neque in integro nouum. Nam sicut illud omnino error eorum non
recipit ita ex uirgine generationem filii non uult admittere, ne humano
corpore polluta uideatur dei fuisse natura. Sed de his hactenus; suo enim
loco ponentur sicut ordo necessarius postularit.</p>

<p id="id00222">Ergo diuina ex aeterno natura et in aeternum sine aliqua mutabilitate
perdurans sibi tantum conscia uoluntate sponte mundum uoluit fabricare
eumque cum omnino non esset fecit ut esset, nec ex sua substantia protulit,
ne diuinus natura crederetur, neque aliunde molitus est, ne iam exstitisse
aliquid quod eius uoluntatem exsistentia propriae naturae iuuaret atque
esset quod neque ab ipso factum esset et tamen esset; sed uerbo produxit
caelos, terram creauit, ita ut caelesti habitatione dignas caelo naturas
efficeret ac terrae terrena componeret. De caelestibus autem naturis, quae
uniuersaliter uocatur angelica, quamuis illic distinctis ordinibus pulchra
sint omnia, pars tamen quaedam plus appetens quam ei natura atque ipsius
auctor naturae tribuerat de caelesti sede proiecta est; et quoniam
angelorum numerum, id est supernae illius ciuitatis cuius ciues angeli
sunt, imminutum noluit conditor permanere, formauit ex terra hominem atque
spiritu uitae animauit, ratione composuit, arbitrii libertate decorauit
eumque praefixa lege paradisi deliciis constituit, ut, si sine peccato
manere uellet, tam ipsum quam eius progeniem angelicis coetibus sociaret,
ut quia superior natura per superbiae malum ima petierat, inferior
substantia per humilitatis bonum ad superna conscenderet. Sed ille auctor
inuidiae non ferens hominem illuc ascendere ubi ipse non meruit permanere,
temptatione adhibita fecit etiam ipsum eiusque comparem, quam de eius
latere generandi causa formator produxerat, inoboedientiae suppliciis
subiacere, ei quoque diuinitatem affuturam promittens, quam sibi dum
arroganter usurpat elisus est. Haec autem reuelante deo Moysi famulo suo
comperta sunt, cui etiam humani generis conditionem atque originem uoluit
innotescere, sicut ab eo libri prolati testantur. Omnis enim diuina
auctoritas his modis constare uidetur, ut aut historialis modus sit, qui
nihil aliud nisi res gestas enuntiet, aut allegoricus, ut non illic possit
historiae ordo consistere, aut certe ex utrisque compositus, ut et secundum
historiam et secundum allegoriam manere uideatur. Haec autem pie
intelligentibus et ueraci corde tenentibus satis abundeque relucent. Sed ad
ordinem redeamus.</p>

<p id="id00223">Primus itaque homo ante peccatum cum sua coniuge incola paradisi fuit. At
ubi aurem praebuit suasori et conditoris praeceptum neglexit attendere,
exul effectus, terram iussus excolere atque a paradisi sinu seclusus in
ignotis partibus sui generis posteritatem transposuit atque poenam quam
ipse primus homo praeuaricationis reus exceperat generando transmisit in
posteros. Hinc factum est ut et corporum atque animarum corruptio et mortis
proueniret interitus primusque mortem in Abel filio suo meruit experiri, ut
quanta esset poena quam ipse exceperit probaret in subole. Quod si ipse
primus moreretur, nesciret quodam modo ac, si dici fas est, nec sentiret
poenam suam, sed ideo expertus in altero est, ut quid sibi iure deberetur
contemptor agnosceret et dum poenam mortis sustinet, ipsa exspectatione
fortius torqueretur. Hoc autem praeuaricationis malum, quod in posteros
naturaliter primus homo transfuderat, quidam Pelagius non admittens proprii
nominis haeresim dedicauit, quam catholica fides a consortio sui mox
reppulisse probatur. Ab ipso itaque primo homine procedens humanum genus ac
multiplici numerositate succrescens erupit in lites, commouit bella,
occupauit terrenam miseriam quia[40] felicitatem paradisi in primo patre
perdiderat. Nec tamen ex his defuerunt quos sibi conditor gratiae
sequestraret eiusque placitis inseruirent; quos licet meritum naturae
damnaret, futuri tamen sacramenti et longe postmodum proferendi faciendo
participes perditam uoluit reparare naturam. Impletus est ergo mundus
humano genere atque ingressus est homo uias suas qui malitia propriae
contumaciae despexerat conditorem. Hinc uolens deus per iustum potius
hominem reparare genus humanum quam manere proteruum, poenalem multitudinem
effusa diluuii inundatione excepto Noe iusto homine cum suis liberis atque
his quae secum in arcam introduxerat interire permisit. Cur autem per arcae
lignum uoluerit iustos eripere, notum est diuinarum scripturarum mentibus
eruditis. Et quasi prima quaedam mundi aetas diluuio ultore transacta est.</p>

<p id="id00224">Reparatur itaque humanum genus atque propriae naturae uitium, quod
praeuaricationis primus auctor infuderat, amplecti non destitit. Creuitque
contumacia quam dudum diluuii unda puniuerat et qui numerosam annorum
seriem permissus fuerat uiuere, in breuitate annorum humana aetas addicta
est. Maluitque deus non iam diluuio punire genus humanum, sed eodem
permanente eligere uiros per quorum seriem aliqua generatio commearet, ex
qua nobis filium proprium uestitum humano corpore mundi in fine concederet.
Quorum primus est Abraham, qui cum esset aetate confectus eiusque uxor
decrepita, in senectute sua repromissionis largitione habere filium
meruerunt. Hic uocatus est Isaac atque ipse genuit Iacob. Idem quoque
duodecim patriarchas non reputante deo in eorum numero quos more suo natura
produxerat. Hic ergo Iacob cum filiis ac domo sua transigendi causa
Aegyptum uoluit habitare atque illic per annorum seriem multitudo
concrescens coeperunt suspicioni esse[41] Aegyptiacis imperiis eosque
Pharao magna ponderum mole premi decreuerat et grauibus oneribus
affligebat. Tandem deus Aegyptii regis dominationem despiciens diuiso mari
rubro, quod numquam antea natura ulla cognouerat, suum transduxit exercitum
auctore Moyse et Aaron. Postea igitur pro eorum egressione altis Aegyptus
plagis uastata est, cum nollet dimittere populum. Transmisso itaque ut
dictum est mari rubro uenit per deserta eremi ad montem qui uocatur Sinai,
ibique uniuersorum conditor deus uolens sacramenti futuri gratia populos
erudire per Moysen data lege constituit, quemadmodum et sacrificiorum ritus
et populorum mores instruerentur. Et cum multis annis multas quoque gentes
per uiam debellassent, uenerunt tandem ad fluuium qui uocatur Iordanis duce
iam Iesu Naue filio atque ad eorum transitum quemadmodum aquae maris rubri
ita quoque Iordanis fluenta siccata sunt; peruentumque est ad eam ciuitatem
quae nunc Hierosolyma uocatur. Atque dum ibi dei populus moraretur, post
iudices et prophetas reges instituti leguntur, quorum post Saulem primatum
Dauid de tribu Iuda legitur adeptus fuisse. Descendit itaque ab eo per
singulas successiones regium stemma perductumque est usque ad Herodis
tempora, qui primus ex gentilibus memoratis populis legitur imperasse. Sub
quo exstitit beata uirgo Maria quae de Dauidica stirpe prouenerat, quae
humani generis genuit conditorem. Hoc autem ideo quia multis infectus
criminibus mundus iacebat in morte, electa est una gens in qua dei mandata
clarescerent, ibique missi prophetae sunt et alii sancti uiri per quorum
admonitionem ipse certe populus a tumore peruicaciae reuocaretur. Illi uero
eosdem occidentes in suae nequitiae peruersitate manere uoluerunt.</p>

<p id="id00225">Atque iam in ultimis temporibus non prophetas neque alios sibi placitos sed
ipsum unigenitum suum deus per uirginem nasci constituit, ut humana salus
quae per primi hominis inoboedientiam deperierat per hominem deum rursus
repararetur et quia exstiterat mulier quae causam mortis prima uiro
suaserat, esset haec secunda mulier quae uitae causam humanis uisceribus
apportaret. Nec uile uideatur quod dei filius ex uirgine natus est, quoniam
praeter naturae modum conceptus et editus est. Virgo itaque de spiritu
sancto incarnatum dei filium concepit, uirgo peperit, post eius editionem
uirgo permansit; atque hominis factus est idemque dei filius, ita ut in eo
et diuinae naturae radiaret splendor et humanae fragilitatis appareret
assumptio. Sed huic tam sanae atque ueracissimae fidei exstiterant multi
qui diuersa garrirent et praeter alios Nestorius et Eutyches repertores
haereseos exstiterunt, quorum unus hominem solum, alter deum solum putauit
asserere nec humanum corpus quod Christus induerat de humanae substantiae
participatione uenisse. Sed haec hactenus.</p>

<p id="id00226">Creuit itaque secundum carnem Christus, baptizatus est, ut qui baptizandi
formam erat ceteris tributurus, ipse primus quod docebat exciperet. Post
baptismum uero elegit duodecim discipulos, quorum unus traditor eius fuit.
Et quia sanam doctrinam Iudaeorum populus non ferebat, eum inlata manu
crucis supplicio peremerunt. Occiditur ergo Christus, iacet tribus diebus
ac noctibus in sepulcro, resurgit a mortuis, sicut ante constitutionem
mundi ipse cum patre decreuerat, ascendit in caelos ubi, in eo quod dei
filius est, numquam defuisse cognoscitur, ut assumptum hominem, quem
diabolus non permiserat ad superna conscendere, secum dei filius caelesti
habitationi sustolleret. Dat ergo formam discipulis suis baptizandi,
docendi salutaria, efficientiam quoque miraculorum atque in uniuersum
mundum ad uitam praecipit introire, ut praedicatio salutaris non iam in una
tantum gente sed orbi terrarum praedicaretur. Et quoniam humanum genus
naturae merito, quam ex primo praeuaricatore contraxerat, aeternae poenae
iaculis fuerat uulneratum nec salutis suae erat idoneum, quod eam in
parente perdiderat, medicinalia quaedam tribuit sacramenta, ut agnosceret
aliud sibi deberi per naturae meritum, aliud per gratiae donum, ut natura
nihil aliud nisi poenae summitteret, gratia uero, quae nullis meritis
attributa est, quia nec gratia diceretur si meritis tribueretur, totum quod
est salutis afferret.</p>

<p id="id00227">Diffunditur ergo per mundum caelestis illa doctrina, adunantur populi,
instituuntur ecclesiae, fit unum corpus quod mundi latitudinem occuparet,
cuius caput Christus ascendit in caelos, ut necessario caput suum membra
sequerentur. Haec itaque doctrina et praesentem uitam bonis informat
operibus et post consummationem saeculi resurrectura corpora nostra praeter
corruptionem ad regna caelestia pollicetur, ita ut qui hic bene ipso
donante uixerit, esset in illa resurrectione beatissimus, qui uero male,
miser post munus resurrectionis adesset. Et hoc est principale religionis
nostrae, ut credat non solum animas non perire, sed ipsa quoque corpora,
quae mortis aduentus resoluerat, in statum pristinum futura de beatitudine
reparari. Haec ergo ecclesia catholica per orbem diffusa tribus modis
probatur exsistere: quidquid in ea tenetur, aut auctoritas est scripturarum
aut traditio uniuersalis aut certe propria et particularis instructio. Sed
auctoritate tota constringitur, uniuersali traditione maiorum nihilominus
tota, priuatis uero constitutionibus et propriis informationibus unaquaeque
uel pro locorum uarietate uel prout cuique bene uisum est subsistit et
regitur. Sola ergo nunc est fidelium exspectatio qua credimus affuturum
finem mundi, omnia corruptibilia transitura, resurrecturos homines ad
examen futuri iudicii, recepturos pro meritis singulos et in perpetuum
atque in aeternum debitis finibus permansuros; solumque est[42] praemium
beatitudinis contemplatio conditoris—tanta dumtaxat, quanta a creatura ad
creatorem fieri potest,—ut ex eis reparato angelico numero superna illa
ciuitas impleatur, ubi rex est uirginis filius eritque gaudium sempiternum,
delectatio, cibus, opus, laus perpetua creatoris.</p>

<h2 id="id00231" style="margin-top: 4em">  ON THE CATHOLIC FAITH[43]</h2>

<p id="id00232" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The Christian Faith is proclaimed by the authority of the New Testament
  and of the Old; but although the Old scripture[44] contains within its
  pages the name of Christ and constantly gives token that He will come
  who we believe has already come by the birth of the Virgin, yet the
  diffusion of that faith throughout the world dates from the actual
  miraculous coming of our Saviour.</p>

<p id="id00233" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Now this our religion which is called Christian and Catholic is founded
  chiefly on the following assertions. From all eternity, that is, before
  the world was established, and so before all that is meant by time
  began, there has existed one divine substance of Father, Son, and Holy
  Spirit in such wise that we confess the Father God, the Son God, and the
  Holy Spirit God, and yet not three Gods but one God. Thus the Father
  hath the Son, begotten of His substance and coeternal with Himself after
  a manner that He alone knoweth. Him we confess to be Son in the sense
  that He is not the same as the Father. Nor has the Father ever been Son,
  for the human mind must not imagine a divine lineage stretching back
  into infinity; nor can the Son, being of the same nature in virtue of
  which He is coeternal with the Father, ever become Father, for the
  divine lineage must not stretch forward into infinity. But the Holy
  Spirit is neither Father nor Son, and therefore, albeit of the same
  divine nature, neither begotten, nor begetting, but proceeding as well
  from the Father as the Son.[45] Yet what the manner of that Procession
  is we are no more able to state clearly than is the human mind able to
  understand the generation of the Son from the substance of the Father.
  But these articles are laid down for our belief by Old and New
  Testament. Concerning which fortress and citadel[46] of our religion
  many men have spoken otherwise and have even impugned it, being moved by
  human, nay rather by carnal feeling. Arius, for instance, who, while
  calling the Son God, declares Him to be vastly inferior to the Father
  and of another substance. The Sabellians also have dared to affirm that
  there are not three separate Persons but only One, saying that the
  Father is the same as the Son and the Son the same as the Father and the
  Holy Spirit the same as the Father and the Son; and so declaring that
  there is but one divine Person expressed by different names.</p>

<p id="id00234" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The Manichaeans, too, who allow two coeternal and contrary principles,
  do not believe in the Only-begotten Son of God. For they consider it a
  thought unworthy of God that He should have a Son, since they entertain
  the very carnal reflection that inasmuch as[47] human generation arises
  from the mingling of two bodies, it is unworthy to hold a notion of this
  sort in respect of the divine nature; whereas such a view finds no
  sanction in the Old Testament and absolutely[48] none in the New. Yea,
  their error which refuses this notion also refuses the Virgin birth of
  the Son, because they would not have the God's nature defiled by the
  man's body. But enough of this for the present; the points will be
  presented in the proper place as the proper arrangement demands.</p>

<p id="id00235" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The divine nature then, abiding from all eternity and unto all eternity
  without any change, by the exercise of a will known only to Himself,
  determined of Himself to form the world, and brought it into being when
  it was absolutely naught, nor did He produce it from His own substance,
  lest it should be thought divine by nature, nor did He form it after any
  model, lest it should be thought that anything had already come into
  being which helped His will by the existence of an independent nature,
  and that there should exist something that had not been made by Him and
  yet existed; but by His Word He brought forth the heavens, and created
  the earth[49] that so He might make natures worthy of a place in heaven,
  and also fit earthly things to earth. But although in heaven all things
  are beautiful and arranged in due order, yet one part of the heavenly
  creation which is universally termed angelic,[50] seeking more than
  nature and the Author of Nature had granted them, was cast forth from
  its heavenly habitation; and because the Creator did not wish the roll
  of the angels, that is of the heavenly city whose citizens the angels
  are, to be diminished, He formed man out of the earth and breathed into
  him the breath of life; He endowed him with reason, He adorned him with
  freedom of choice and established him in the joys of Paradise, making
  covenant aforehand that if he would remain without sin He would add him
  and his offspring to the angelic hosts; so that as the higher nature had
  fallen low through the curse of pride, the lower substance might ascend
  on high through the blessing of humility. But the father of envy, loath
  that man should climb to the place where he himself deserved not to
  remain, put temptation before him and the consort whom the Creator had
  brought forth out of his side for the continuance of the race, and laid
  them open to punishment for disobedience, promising man also the gift of
  Godhead, the arrogant attempt to seize which had caused his own fall.
  All this was revealed by God to His servant Moses, whom He vouchsafed to
  teach the creation and origin of man, as the books written by him
  declare. For the divine authority is always conveyed in one of the
  following ways—the historical, which simply announces facts; the
  allegorical, whence historical matter is excluded; or else the two
  combined, history and allegory conspiring to establish it. All this is
  abundantly evident to pious hearers and steadfast believers.</p>

<p id="id00236" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But to return to the order of our discourse; the first man, before sin
  came, dwelt with his consort in the Garden. But when he hearkened to the
  voice of his wife and failed to keep the commandment of his Creator, he
  was banished, bidden to till the ground, and being shut out from the
  sheltering garden he carried abroad into unknown regions the children of
  his loins; by begetting whom he transmitted to those that came after,
  the punishment which he, the first man, had incurred by the sin of
  disobedience. Hence it came to pass that corruption both of body and
  soul ensued, and death; and this he was to taste first in his own son
  Abel, in order that he might learn through his child the greatness of
  the punishment that was laid upon him. For if he had died first he would
  in some sense not have known, and if one may so say not have felt, his
  punishment; but he tasted it in another in order that he might perceive
  the due reward of his contempt, and, doomed to death himself, might be
  the more sensibly touched by the apprehension of it. But this curse that
  came of transgression which the first man had by natural propagation
  transmitted to posterity, was denied by one Pelagius who so set up the
  heresy which goes by his name and which the Catholic faith, as is known,
  at once banished from its bosom. So the human race that sprang from the
  first man and mightily increased and multiplied, broke into strife,
  stirred up wars, and became the heir of earthly misery, because it had
  lost the joys of Paradise in its first parent. Yet were there not a few
  of mankind whom the Giver of Grace set apart for Himself and who were
  obedient to His will; and though by desert of nature they were
  condemned, yet God by making them partakers in the hidden mystery, long
  afterwards to be revealed, vouchsafed to recover fallen nature. So the
  earth was filled by the human race and man who by his own wanton
  wilfulness had despised his Creator began to walk in his own ways. Hence
  God willing rather to recover mankind through one just man than that it
  should remain for ever contumacious, suffered all the guilty multitude
  to perish by the wide waters of a flood, save only Noah, the just one,
  with his children and all that he had brought with him into the ark. The
  reason why He wished to save the just by an ark of wood is known to all
  hearts learned in the Holy Scriptures. Thus what we may call the first
  age of the world was ended by the avenging flood.</p>

<p id="id00237" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Thus the human race was restored, and yet it hastened to make its own
  the vice of nature with which the first author of transgression had
  infected it. And the wickedness increased which had once been punished
  by the waters of the flood, and man who had been suffered to live for a
  long series of years was reduced to the brief span of ordinary human
  life. Yet would not God again visit the race by a flood, but rather,
  letting it continue, He chose from it men of whose line a generation
  should arise out of which He might in the last days grant us His own Son
  to come to us, clothed in human form. Of these men Abraham is the first,
  and although he was stricken in years and his wife past bearing, they
  had in their old age the reward of a son in fulfilment of promise
  unconditional. This son was named Isaac and he begat Jacob, who in his
  turn begat the twelve Patriarchs, God not reckoning in their number
  those whom nature in its ordinary course produced.[51] This Jacob, then,
  together with his sons and his household determined to dwell in Egypt
  for the purpose of trafficking; and the multitude of them increasing
  there in the course of many years began to be a cause of suspicion to
  the Egyptian rulers, and Pharaoh ordered them to be oppressed by
  exceeding heavy tasks[52] and afflicted them with grievous burdens. At
  length God, minded to set at naught the tyranny of the king of Egypt,
  divided the Red Sea—a marvel such as nature had never known before—and
  brought forth His host by the hands of Moses and Aaron. Thereafter on
  account of their departure Egypt was vexed with sore plagues, because
  they would not let the people go. So, after crossing the Red Sea, as I
  have told, they passed through the desert of the wilderness and came to
  the mount which is called Sinai, where God the Creator of all, wishing
  to prepare the nations for the knowledge of the sacrament to come, laid
  down by a law given through Moses how both the rites of sacrifices and
  the national customs should be ordered. And after fighting down many
  tribes in many years amidst their journeyings they came at last to the
  river called Jordan, with Joshua the son of Nun now as their captain,
  and, for their crossing, the streams of Jordan were dried up as the
  waters of the Red Sea had been; so they finished their course to that
  city which is now called Jerusalem. And while the people of God abode
  there we read that there were set up first judges and prophets and then
  kings, of whom we read that after Saul, David of the tribe of Judah
  ascended the throne. So from him the royal race descended from father to
  son and lasted till the days of Herod who, we read, was the first taken
  out of the peoples called Gentile to bear sway. In whose days rose up
  the blessed Virgin Mary, sprung from the stock of David, she who bore
  the Maker of the human race. But it was just because the whole world lay
  dead, stained with its many sins, that God chose out one race in which
  His commands might shine clear; sending it prophets and other holy men,
  to the end that by their warnings that people at least might be cured of
  their swollen pride. But they slew these holy men and chose rather to
  abide in their wanton wickedness.</p>

<p id="id00238" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  And now at the last days of time, in place of prophets and other men
  well-pleasing to Him, God willed that His only-begotten Son should be
  born of a Virgin that so the salvation of mankind which had been lost
  through the disobedience of the first man might be recovered by the God-
  man, and that inasmuch as it was a woman who had first persuaded man to
  that which wrought death there should be this second woman who should
  bring forth from a human womb Him who gives Life. Nor let it be deemed a
  thing unworthy that the Son of God was born of a Virgin, for it was out
  of the course of nature that He was conceived and brought to birth.
  Virgin then she conceived, by the Holy Spirit, the Son of God made
  flesh, Virgin she bore Him, Virgin she continued after His birth; and He
  became the Son of Man and likewise the Son of God that in Him the glory
  of the divine nature might shine forth and at the same time the human
  weakness be declared which He took upon Him. Yet against this article of
  Faith so wholesome and altogether true there rose up many who babbled
  other doctrine, and especially Nestorius and Eutyches, inventors of
  heresy, of whom the one thought fit to say that He was man alone, the
  other that He was God alone and that the human body put on by Christ had
  not come by participation in human substance. But enough on this point.</p>

<p id="id00239" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  So Christ grew after the flesh, and was baptized in order that He who
  was to give the form of baptism to others should first Himself receive
  what He taught. But after His baptism He chose twelve disciples, one of
  whom betrayed Him. And because the people of the Jews would not bear
  sound doctrine they laid hands upon Him and slew and crucified Him.
  Christ, then, was slain; He lay three days and three nights in the tomb;
  He rose again from the dead as He had predetermined with His Father
  before the foundation of the world; He ascended into heaven whence we
  know that He was never absent, because He is Son of God, in order that
  as Son of God He might raise together with Him to the heavenly
  habitation man whose flesh He had assumed, whom the devil had hindered
  from ascending to the places on high. Therefore He bestowed on His
  disciples the form of baptizing, the saving truth of the teaching, and
  the mighty power of miracles, and bade them go throughout the whole
  world to give it life, in order that the message of salvation might be
  preached no longer in one nation only but among all the dwellers upon
  earth. And because the human race was wounded by the weapon of eternal
  punishment by reason of the nature which they had inherited from the
  first transgressor and could not win a full meed of salvation because
  they had lost it in its first parent, God instituted certain health-
  giving sacraments to teach the difference between what grace bestowed
  and human nature deserved, nature simply subjecting to punishment, but
  grace, which is won by no merit, since it would not be grace if it were
  due to merit, conferring all that belongs to salvation.</p>

<p id="id00240" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Therefore is that heavenly instruction spread throughout the world, the
  peoples are knit together, churches are founded, and, filling the broad
  earth, one body formed, whose head, even Christ, ascended into heaven in
  order that the members might of necessity follow where the Head was
  gone. Thus this teaching both inspires this present life unto good
  works, and promises that in the end of the age our bodies shall rise
  incorruptible to the kingdom of heaven, to the end that he who has lived
  well on earth by God's gift should be altogether blessed in that
  resurrection, but he who has lived amiss should, with the gift of
  resurrection, enter upon misery. And this is a firm principle of our
  religion, to believe not only that men's souls do not perish, but that
  their very bodies, which the coming of death had destroyed, recover
  their first state by the bliss that is to be. This Catholic church,
  then, spread throughout the world, is known by three particular marks:
  whatever is believed and taught in it has the authority of the
  Scriptures, or of universal tradition, or at least of its own and proper
  usage. And this authority is binding on the whole Church as is also the
  universal tradition of the Fathers, while each separate church exists
  and is governed by its private constitution and its proper rites
  according to difference of locality and the good judgment of each. All,
  therefore, that the faithful now expect is that the end of the world
  will come, that all corruptible things shall pass away, that men shall
  rise for future judgement, that each shall receive reward according to
  his deserts and abide in the lot assigned to him for ever and for aye;
  and the sole reward of bliss will be the contemplation of the Almighty,
  so far, that is, as the creature may look on the Creator, to the end
  that the number of the angels may be made up from these and the heavenly
  city filled where the Virgin's Son is King and where will be everlasting
  joy, delight, food, labour, and unending praise of the Creator.</p>

<p id="id00241" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  [43] The conclusions adverse to the genuineness of this tractate,
  reached in the dissertation <i>Der dem Boethius zugeschriebene Traktat de
  Fide Catholica (Jahrbücher für kl. Phil.</i> xxvi. (1901) Supplementband)
  by one of the editors, now seem to both unsound. The writer of that
  dissertation intends to return to the subject elsewhere. This fourth
  tractate, though lacking, in the best MSS., either an ascription to
  Boethius or a title, is firmly imbedded in two distinct recensions of
  Boethius's theological works. There is no reason to disturb it. Indeed
  the <i>capita dogmatica</i> mentioned by Cassiodorus can hardly refer to any
  of the tractates except the fourth.</p>
