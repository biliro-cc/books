<p id="id00855">  Having said thus, she began to turn her speech to treat and explicate
  certain other questions, when I interrupted her, saying: "Thy
  exhortation is very good, and well-seeming thy authority. But I find it
  true by experience, as thou affirmedst, that the question of Providence
  is entangled with many other. For I desire to know whether thou thinkest
  chance to be anything at all, and what it is." "I make haste," quoth
  she, "to perform my promise, and to show thee the way by which thou
  mayest return to thy country. But these other questions, though they be
  very profitable, yet they are somewhat from our purpose, and it is to be
  feared lest being wearied with digressions thou beest not able to finish
  thy direct journey." "There is no fear of that," quoth I, "for it will
  be a great ease to me to understand those things in which I take great
  delight, and withal, when thy disputation is fenced in on every side
  with sure conviction, there can be no doubt made of anything thou shalt
  infer." "I will," quoth she, "do as thou wouldst me have," and withal
  began in this manner. "If any shall define chance to be an event
  produced by a confused motion, and without connexion of causes, I affirm
  that there is no such thing, and that chance is only an empty voice that
  hath beneath it no real signification. For what place can confusion
  have, since God disposeth all things in due order? For it is a true
  sentence that of nothing cometh nothing, which none of the ancients
  denied, though they held not that principle of the efficient cause, but
  of the material subject, laying it down as in a manner the ground of all
  their reasonings concerning nature. But if anything proceedeth from no
  causes, that will seem to have come from nothing, which if it cannot be,
  neither is it possible there should be any such chance as is defined a
  little before." "What then," quoth I, "is there nothing that can rightly
  be called chance or fortune? Or is there something, though unknown to
  the common sort, to which these names agree?" "My Aristotle," quoth she,
  "in his <i>Books of Nature</i>[166] declared this point briefly and very
  near the truth." "How?" quoth I. "When," quoth she, "anything is done
  for some certain cause, and some other thing happeneth for other reasons
  than that which was intended, this is called chance; as if one digging
  his ground with intention to till it, findeth an hidden treasure. This
  is thought to have fallen thus out by fortune, but it is not of nothing,
  for it hath peculiar causes whose unexpected and not foreseen concourse
  seemeth to have brought forth a chance. For unless the husbandman had
  digged up his ground, and unless the other had hidden his money in that
  place, the treasure had not been found. These are therefore the causes
  of this fortunate accident, which proceedeth from the meeting and
  concourse of causes, and not from the intention of the doer. For neither
  he that hid the gold nor he that tilled his ground had any intention
  that the money should be found, but, as I said, it followed and
  concurred that this man should dig up in the place where the other hid.
  Wherefore, we may define chance thus: That it is an unexpected event of
  concurring causes in those things which are done to some end and
  purpose. Now the cause why causes so concur and meet so together, is
  that order proceeding with inevitable connexion, which, descending from
  the fountain of Providence, disposeth all things in their places and
  times.</p>

<p id="id00865" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "I observe it," quoth I, "and I acknowledge it to be as thou sayest. But
  in this rank of coherent causes, have we any free-will, or doth the
  fatal chain fasten also the motions of men's minds?" "We have," quoth
  she, "for there can be no reasonable nature, unless it be endued with
  free-will. For that which naturally hath the use of reason hath also
  judgment by which it can discern of everything by itself, wherefore of
  itself it distinguished betwixt those things which are to be avoided,
  and those which are to be desired. Now every one seeketh for that which
  he thinketh is to be desired, and escheweth that which in his judgment
  is to be avoided. Wherefore, they which have reason in themselves have
  freedom to will and nill. But yet I consider not this equal in all. For
  the supreme and divine substances have both a perspicuous judgment and
  an uncorrupted will, and an effectual power to obtain their desires. But
  the minds of men must needs be more free when they conserve themselves
  in the contemplation of God, and less when they come to their bodies,
  and yet less when they are bound with earthly fetters. But their
  greatest bondage is when, giving themselves to vices, they lose
  possession of their own reason. For, having cast their eyes from the
  light of the sovereign truth to inferior obscurities, forthwith they are
  blinded with the cloud of ignorance, molested with hurtful affections,
  by yielding and consenting to which they increase the bondage which they
  laid upon themselves, and are, after a certain manner, captives by their
  own freedom. Which notwithstanding that foresight of Providence which
  beholdeth all things from eternity, foreseeth, and by predestination
  disposeth of everything by their merits.</p>

"Quaenam," inquit, "ista est? Iam enim quibus perturbere coniecto."
"Nimium," inquam, "aduersari ac repugnare uidetur praenoscere uniuersa deum
et esse ullum libertatis arbitrium. Nam si cuncta prospicit deus neque
falli ullo modo potest, euenire necesse est quod prouidentia futurum esse
praeuiderit. Quare si ab aeterno non facta hominum modo sed etiam consilia
uoluntatesque praenoscit, nulla erit arbitrii libertas; neque enim uel
factum aliud ullum uel quaelibet exsistere poterit uoluntas nisi quam
nescia falli prouidentia diuina praesenserit. Nam si aliorsum quam prouisae
sunt detorqueri ualent, non iam erit futuri firma praescientia, sed opinio
potius incerta, quod de deo credere nefas iudico. Neque enim illam probo
rationem qua se quidam credunt hunc quaestionis nodum posse dissoluere.
Aiunt enim non ideo quid esse euenturum, quoniam id prouidentia futurum
esse prospexerit, sed e contrario potius, quoniam quid futurum est, id
diuinam prouidentiam latere non posse eoque modo necessarium hoc in
contrariam relabi partem, neque enim necesse esse contingere quae
prouidentur, sed necesse esse quae futura sunt prouideri—quasi uero quae
cuius rei causa sit praescientiane futurorum necessitatis an futurorum
necessitas prouidentiae laboretur, ac non illud demonstrare nitamur, quoquo
modo sese habeat ordo causarum, necessarium esse euentum praescitarum
rerum, etiam si praescientia futuris rebus eueniendi necessitatem non
uideatur inferre. Etenim si quispiam sedeat, opinionem quae eum sedere
coniectat ueram esse necesse est; atque e conuerso rursus, si de quopiam
uera sit opinio quoniam sedet, eum sedere necesse est. In utroque igitur
necessitas inest, in hoc quidem sedendi, at uero in altero ueritatis. Sed
non idcirco quisque sedet quoniam uera est opinio, sed haec potius uera est
quoniam quempiam sedere praecessit. Ita cum causa ueritatis ex altera parte
procedat, inest tamen communis in utraque necessitas.</p>

<p id="id00876">Similia de prouidentia futurisque rebus ratiocinari patet. Nam etiam si
idcirco quoniam futura sunt, prouidentur, non uero ideo quoniam prouidentur
eueniunt, nihilo minus tamen ab deo uel uentura prouideri uel prouisa
necesse est euenire,[171] quod ad perimendam arbitrii libertatem solum
satis est. Iam uero quam praeposterum est ut aeternae praescientiae
temporalium rerum euentus causa esse dicatur! Quid est autem aliud
arbitrari ideo deum futura quoniam sunt euentura prouidere, quam putare
quae olim acciderunt causam summae illius esse prouidentiae? Ad haec sicuti
cum quid esse scio, id ipsum esse necesse est, ita cum quid futurum noui,
id ipsum futurum esse necesse est. Sic fit igitur ut euentus praescitae rei
nequeat euitari. Postremo si quid aliquis aliorsum atque sese res habet
existimet, id non modo scientia non est, sed est opinio fallax ab scientiae
ueritate longe diuersa. Quare si quid ita futurum est ut eius certus ac
necessarius non sit euentus, id euenturum esse praesciri qui poterit? Sicut
enim scientia ipsa impermixta est falsitati, ita id quod ab ea concipitur
esse aliter atque concipitur nequit. Ea namque causa est cur mendacio
scientia careat, quod se ita rem quamque habere necesse est uti eam sese
habere scientia comprehendit. Quid igitur? Quonam modo deus haec incerta
futura praenoscit? Nam si ineuitabiliter euentura censet quae etiam non
euenire possibile est, fallitur; quod non sentire modo nefas est, sed etiam
uoce proferre. At si ita uti sunt, ita ea futura esse decernit, ut aeque
uel fieri ea uel non fieri posse cognoscat, quae est haec praescientia quae
nihil certum nihil stabile comprehendit? Aut quid hoc refert uaticinio illo
ridiculo Tiresiae?</p>

<p id="id00877">  Quidquid dicam, aut erit aut non.</p>

<p id="id00878">Quid etiam diuina prouidentia humana opinione praestiterit; si uti homines
incerta iudicat quorum est incertus euentus? Quod si apud illum rerum
omnium certissimum fontem nihil incerti esse potest, certus eorum est
euentus quae futura firmiter ille praescierit. Quare nulla est humanis
consiliis actionibusque libertas quas diuina mens sine falsitatis errore
cuncta prospiciens ad unum alligat et constringit euentum. Quo semel
recepto quantus occasus humanarum rerum consequatur liquet. Frustra enim
bonis malisque praemia poenaeue proponuntur quae nullus meruit liber ac
uoluntarius motus animorum. Idque omnium uidebitur iniquissimum quod nunc
aequissimum iudicatur uel puniri improbos uel remunerari probos quos ad
alterutrum non propria mittit uoluntas, sed futuri cogit certa necessitas.
Nec uitia igitur nec uirtutes quidquam fuerint, sed omnium meritorum potius
mixta atque indiscreta confusio. Quoque nihil sceleratius excogitari
potest, cum ex prouidentia rerum omnis ordo ducatur nihilque consiliis
liceat humanis, fit ut uitia quoque nostra ad bonorum omnium referantur
auctorem. Igitur nec sperandi aliquid nec deprecandi ulla ratio est. Quid

<p id="id00881" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Then I complained that I was now in a greater confusion and more
  doubtful difficulty than before. "What is that?" quoth she, "for I
  already conjecture what it is that troubleth thee." "It seemeth," quoth
  I, "to be altogether impossible and repugnant that God foreseeth all
  things, and that there should be any free-will. For if God beholdeth all
  things and cannot be deceived, that must of necessity follow which His
  providence foreseeth to be to come. Wherefore, if from eternity he doth
  not only foreknow the deeds of men, but also their counsels and wills,
  there can be no free-will; for there is not any other deed or will, but
  those which the divine providence, that cannot be deceived, hath
  foreseen. For if things can be drawn aside to any other end than was
  foreknown, there will not be any firm knowledge of that which is to
  come, but rather an uncertain opinion, which in my opinion were impious
  to believe of God. Neither do I allow of that reason with which some
  suppose that they can dissolve the difficulty of this question. For they
  say that nothing is therefore to come to pass because Providence did
  foresee it, but rather contrariwise, because it shall be, it could not
  be unknown to Providence, and in this manner the necessity passes over
  to the other side. For it is not necessary, they argue, that those
  things should happen which are foreseen, but it is necessary that those
  things should be foreseen that are to come—as though our problem were
  this, which of them is the cause of a thing, the foreknowledge of the
  necessity of things to come, or the necessity of the foreknowledge of
  things to come, and we were not trying to prove that, howsoever these
  causes be ordered, the event of the things which are foreknown is
  necessary, even though the foreknowledge seemeth not to confer necessity
  of being upon the things themselves. For if any man sitteth the opinion
  which thinketh so must needs be true, and again on the other side, if
  the opinion that one sitteth be true, he must needs sit. Wherefore,
  there is necessity in both, in the one of sitting and in the other of
  truth. But one sitteth not because the opinion is true, but rather this
  is true because one hath taken his seat. So that though the cause of
  truth proceedeth from one part, yet there is a common necessity in both.</p>

<p id="id00882" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  And the like is to be inferred of Providence and future things. For even
  though they be foreseen because they shall be, yet they do not come to
  pass because they are foreseen, notwithstanding it is necessary that
  either things to come be foreseen by God, or that things foreseen do
  fall out, which alone is sufficient to overthrow free-will. But see how
  preposterous it is that the event of temporal things should be said to
  be the cause of the everlasting foreknowledge! And what else is it to
  think that God doth therefore foresee future things, because they are to
  happen, than to affirm that those things which happened long since, are
  the cause of that sovereign providence? Furthermore, as when I know
  anything to be, it must needs be; so when I know that anything shall be,
  it must needs be to come. And so it followeth that the event of a thing
  foreknown cannot be avoided. Finally, if any man thinketh otherwise than
  the thing is, that is not only no knowledge, but it is a deceitful
  opinion far from the truth of knowledge; wherefore, if anything is to be
  in such sort that the event of it is not certain or necessary, how can
  that be foreknown that it shall happen? For as knowledge is without
  mixture of falsity, so that which is conceived by it cannot be otherwise
  than it is conceived. For this is the cause why knowledge is without
  deceit, because everything must needs be so as the knowledge
  apprehendeth it to be. What then? How doth God foreknow that these
  uncertain things shall be? For if He judgeth that those things shall
  happen inevitably, which it is possible shall not happen, He is
  deceived, which is not only impious to think, but also to speak. But if
  He supposeth that they shall happen in such sort as they are, so that He
  knoweth that they may equally be done and not be done, what
  foreknowledge is this which comprehendeth no certain or stable thing? Or
  in what is this better than that ridiculous prophecy of Tiresias
  "Whatsoever I say shall either be or not be"[172]? or in what shall the
  divine providence exceed human opinion, if, as men, God judgeth those
  things to be uncertain the event of which is doubtful? But if nothing
  can be uncertain to that most certain fountain of all things, the
  occurrence of those things is certain, which He doth certainly know
  shall be. Wherefore there is no freedom in human counsels and actions,
  which the divine mind, foreseeing all things without error or falsehood,
  tieth and bindeth to one event. Which once admitted, it is evident what
  ruin of human affairs will ensue. For in vain are rewards and
  punishments proposed to good and evil, which no free and voluntary
  motion of their minds hath deserved. And that will seem most unjust
  which is now judged most just, that either the wicked should be punished
  or the good rewarded, since their own will leadeth them to neither, but
  they are compelled by the certain necessity of that which is to come. By
  which means virtues and vices shall be nothing, but rather there will
  follow a mixed confusion of all deserts. And—than which there can be
  nothing invented more impious—since that all order of things proceedeth
  from Providence, and human counsels can do nothing, it followeth that
  our vices also shall be referred to the author of goodness. Wherefore
  there is no means left to hope or pray for anything, since an unflexible
  course connecteth all things that can be desired! Wherefore that only
  traffic betwixt God and men of hope and prayer shall be taken away: if
  indeed by the price of just humility we deserve the unestimable benefit
  of God's grace; for this is the only manner by which it seemeth that men
  may talk with God, and by the very manner of supplication be joined to
  that inaccessible light before they obtain anything; which if by the
  admitting the necessity of future things, they be thought to have no
  force, by what shall we be united and cleave to that Sovereign Prince of
  all things? Wherefore mankind must needs (as thou saidest in thy verse a
  little before), being separated and severed from its source, fail and
  fall away.</p>

  Doth she with such a love of truth desire?<br/>

  If she knows that which she doth so require,<br/>

  Why wisheth she known things to know again?<br/>

  If she knows not, why strives she with blind pain?<br/>

  Who after things unknown will strive to go?<br/>

  Or will such ignorant pursuit maintain?<br/>

  How shall she find them out? Or having so,<br/>

  How shall she then their forms and natures know?<br/>

  Because this soul the highest mind did view,<br/>

  Must we needs say that it all nature knew?<br/>

  Now she, though clouds of flesh do her debar,<br/>

  Forgets not all that was her ancient due,<br/>

  But in her mind some general motions are,<br/>

  Though not the skill of things particular.<br/>

  He that seeks truth in neither course doth fall;<br/>

  Not knowing all, nor ignorant of all,<br/>

<p id="id00890">Tum illa: "Vetus," inquit, "haec est de prouidentia querela Marcoque
Tullio, cum diuinationem distribuit, uehementer agitata tibique ipsi res
diu prorsus multumque quaesita, sed haud quaquam ab ullo uestrum hactenus
satis diligenter ac firmiter expedita. Cuius caliginis causa est, quod
humanae ratiocinationis motus ad diuinae praescientiae simplicitatem non
potest admoueri, quae si ullo modo cogitari queat, nihil prorsus
relinquetur ambigui. Quod ita demum patefacere atque expedire temptabo, si
prius ea quibus moueris expendero. Quaero enim, cur illam soluentium
rationem minus efficacem putes, quae quia praescientiam non esse futuris
rebus causam necessitatis existimat, nihil impediri praescientia arbitrii
libertatem putat. Num enim tu aliunde argumentum futurorum necessitatis
trahis, nisi quod ea quae praesciuntur non euenire non possunt? Si igitur
praenotio nullam futuris rebus adicit necessitatem, quod tu etiam paulo
ante fatebare, quid est quod uoluntarii exitus rerum ad certum cogantur
euentum? Etenim positionis gratia, ut quid consequatur aduertas, statuamus
nullam esse praescientiam. Num igitur quantum ad hoc attinet, quae ex
arbitrio eueniunt ad necessitatem cogantur?" "Minime." "Statuamus iterum
esse, sed nihil rebus necessitatis iniungere; manebit ut opinor eadem
uoluntatis integra atque absoluta libertas.</p>

<p id="id00891">Sed praescientia, inquies, tametsi futuris eueniendi necessitas non est,
signum tamen est necessario ea esse uentura. Hoc igitur modo, etiam si
praecognitio non fuisset, necessarios futurorum exitus esse constaret. Omne
etenim signum tantum quid sit ostendit, non uero efficit quod designat.
Quare demonstrandum prius est nihil non ex necessitate contingere, ut
praenotionem signum esse huius necessitatis appareat. Alioquin si haec
nulla est, ne illa quidem eius rei signum poterit esse quae non est. Iam
uero probationem firma ratione subnixam constat non ex signis neque petitis
extrinsecus argumentis sed ex conuenientibus necessariisque causis esse
ducendam. Sed qui fieri potest ut ea non proueniant quae futura esse
prouidentur? Quasi uero nos ea quae prouidentia futura esse praenoscit non
esse euentura credamus ac non illud potius arbitremur, licet eueniant,
nihil tamen ut euenirent sui natura necessitatis habuisse; quod hinc facile
perpendas licebit. Plura etenim dum fiunt subiecta oculis intuemur, ut ea
quae in quadrigis moderandis atque flectendis facere spectantur aurigae
atque ad hunc modum cetera. Num igitur quidquam illorum ita fieri
necessitas ulla compellit?" "Minime. Frustra enim esset artis effectus, si
omnia coacta mouerentur." "Quae igitur cum fiunt carent exsistendi
necessitate, eadem prius quam fiant sine necessitate futura sunt. Quare
sunt quaedam euentura quorum exitus ab omni necessitate sit absolutus. Nam
illud quidem nullum arbitror esse dicturum, quod quae nunc fiunt, prius
quam fierent, euentura non fuerint. Haec igitur etiam praecognita liberos
habent euentus. Nam sicut scientia praesentium rerum nihil his quae fiunt,
ita praescientia futurorum nihil his quae uentura sunt necessitatis
importat. Sed hoc, inquis, ipsum dubitatur, an earum rerum quae necessarios
exitus non habent ulla possit esse praenotio. Dissonare etenim uidentur
putasque si praeuideantur consequi necessitatem, si necessitas desit minime
praesciri nihilque scientia comprehendi posse nisi certum; quod si quae
incerti sunt exitus ea quasi certa prouidentur, opinionis id esse caliginem
non scientiae ueritatem. Aliter enim ac sese res habeat arbitrari ab
integritate scientiae credis esse diuersum. Cuius erroris causa est, quod
omnia quae quisque nouit ex ipsorum tantum ui atque natura cognosci
aestimat quae sciuntur; quod totum contra est Omne enim quod cognoscitur
non secundum sui uim sed secundum cognoscentium potius comprehenditur
facultatem. Nam ut hoc breui liqueat exemplo, eandem corporis rotunditatem
aliter uisus aliter tactus agnoscit. Ille eminus manens totum simul iactis
radiis intuetur; hic uero cohaerens orbi atque coniunctus circa ipsum motus
ambitum rotunditatem partibus comprehendit. Ipsum quoque hominem aliter
sensus, aliter imaginatio, aliter ratio, aliter intellegentia contuetur.
Sensus enim figuram in subiecta materia constitutam, imaginatio uero solam
sine materia iudicat figuram. Ratio uero hanc quoque transcendit speciemque
ipsam quae singularibus inest uniuersali consideratione perpendit.
Intellegentiae uero celsior oculus exsistit; supergressa namque
uniuersitatis ambitum ipsam illam simplicem formam pura mentis acie
contuetur.</p>

<p id="id00892">In quo illud maxime considerandum est: nam superior comprehendendi uis
amplectitur inferiorem, inferior uero ad superiorem nullo modo consurgit.
Neque enim sensus aliquid extra materiam ualet uel uniuersales species
imaginatio contuetur uel ratio capit simplicem formam, sed intellegentia
quasi desuper spectans concepta forma quae subsunt etiam cuncta diiudicat,
sed eo modo quo formam ipsam, quae nulli alii nota esse poterat,
comprehendit. Nam et rationis uniuersum et imaginationis figuram et
materiale sensibile cognoscit nec ratione utens nec imaginatione nec
sensibus, sed illo uno ictu mentis formaliter, ut ita dicam, cuncta
prospiciens. Ratio quoque cum quid uniuersale respicit, nec imaginatione
nec sensibus utens imaginabilia uel sensibilia comprehendit. Haec est enim
quae conceptionis suae uniuersale ita definiuit: homo est animal bipes
rationale. Quae cum uniuersalis notio sit, tum imaginabilem sensibilemque
esse rem nullus ignorat, quod illa non imaginatione uel sensu sed in
rationali conceptione considerat. Imaginatio quoque tametsi ex sensibus
uisendi formandique figuras sumpsit exordium, sensu tamen absente
sensibilia quaeque conlustrat non sensibili sed imaginaria ratione
iudicandi. Videsne igitur ut in cognoscendo cuncta sua potius facultate
quam eorum quae cognoscuntur utantur? Neque id iniuria; nam cum omne
iudicium iudicantis actus exsistat, necesse est ut suam quisque operam non
ex aliena sed ex propria potestate perficiat.</p>

<h2 id="id00893" style="margin-top: 4em">  IV.</h2>

<p id="id00894" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "This," quoth she, "is an ancient complaint of providence, vehemently
  pursued by Marcus Tullius in his <i>Distribution of Divination</i>,[174]
  and a thing which thou thyself hast made great and long search after.
  But hitherto none of you have used sufficient diligence and vigour in
  the explication thereof. The cause of which obscurity is for that the
  motion of human discourse cannot attain to the simplicity of the divine
  knowledge, which if by any means we could conceive, there would not
  remain any doubt at all; which I will endeavour to make manifest and
  plain when I have first explicated that which moveth thee. For I demand
  why thou thinkest their solution unsufficient, who think that free-will
  is not hindered by foreknowledge, because they suppose that
  foreknowledge is not the cause of any necessity in things to come. For
  fetchest thou any proof for the necessity of future things from any
  other principle, but only from this, that those things which are
  foreknown cannot choose but happen? Wherefore if foreknowledge imposeth
  no necessity upon future events, which thou didst grant not long before,
  why should voluntary actions be tied to any certain success? For
  example's sake, that thou mayest see what will follow, let us suppose
  that there were no providence or foresight at all. Would those things
  which proceed from free-will be compelled to any necessity by this
  means?" "No." "Again, let us grant it to be, but that it imposeth no
  necessity upon anything; no doubt the same freedom of will will remain
  whole and absolute.</p>

<p id="id00895" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But thou wilt say, even though foreknowledge be not a necessity for
  things to happen, yet it is a sign that they shall necessarily come to
  pass. Wherefore now, even if there had been no foreknowledge, the events
  of future things would have been necessary. For all signs only show what
  is, but cause not that which they design. And consequently it must first
  be proved that all things fall out by necessity, that it may appear that
  foreknowledge is a sign of this necessity. For otherwise, if there be no
  necessity, neither can foreknowledge be the sign of that which is not.
  Besides it is manifest that every firm proof must be drawn from
  intrinsical and necessary causes and not from signs and other farfetched
  arguments. But how is it possible those things should not happen which
  are foreseen to be to come? As though we did believe that those things
  will not be which providence hath foreknown and do not rather judge that
  although they happen, yet by their own nature they had no necessity of
  being, which thou mayest easily gather hence. For we see many things
  with our eyes while they are in doing, as those things which the
  coachmen do while they drive and turn their coaches and in like manner
  other things. Now doth necessity compel any of these things to be done
  in this sort?" "No. For in vain should art labour if all things were
  moved by compulsion." "Wherefore, as these things are without necessity
  when they are in doing, so likewise they are to come without necessity
  before they be done. And consequently there are some things to come
  whose event is free from all necessity. For I suppose no man will say
  that those things which are done now were not to come before they were
  done. Wherefore these things even being foreseen come freely to effect.
  For as the knowledge of things present causeth no necessity in things
  which are in doing, so neither the foreknowledge in things to come. But
  thou wilt say: This is the question, whether there can be any
  foreknowledge of those things whose events are not necessary. For these
  things seem opposite, and thou thinkest that, if future things be
  foreseen, there followeth necessity, if there be no necessity, that they
  that are not foreknown, and that nothing can be perfectly known unless
  it be certain. But if uncertain events be foreseen as certain, it is
  manifest that this is the obscurity of opinion and not the truth of
  knowledge. For thou thinkest it to be far from the integrity of
  knowledge to judge otherwise than the thing is. The cause of which error
  is because thou thinkest that all that is known is known only by the
  force and nature of the things themselves, which is altogether
  otherwise. For all that is known is not comprehended according to the
  force which it hath in itself, but rather according to the faculty of
  them which know it. For to explicate it with a brief example: the sight
  and the feeling do diversely discern the same roundness of a die. The
  sight standing aloof beholdeth it altogether by his beams; but the
  feeling united and joined to the orb, being moved about the compass of
  it, comprehendeth the roundness by parts. Likewise sense, imagination,
  reason and understanding do diversely behold a man. For sense looketh
  upon his form as it is placed in matter or subject, the imagination
  discerneth it alone without matter, reason passeth beyond this also and
  considereth universally the species or kind which is in particulars. The
  eye of the understanding is higher yet. For surpassing the compass of
  the whole world it beholdeth with the clear eye of the mind that simple
  form in itself.</p>

<p id="id00896" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  In which that is chiefly to be considered, that the superior force of
  comprehending embraceth the inferior; but the inferior can by no means
  attain to the superior; for the sense hath no force out of matter,
  neither doth the imagination conceive universal species, nor is reason
  capable of the simple form, but the understanding, as it were looking
  downward, having conceived that form, discerneth of all things which are
  under it, but in that sort in which it apprehendeth that form which can
  be known by none of the other. For it knoweth the universality of
  reason, and the figure of imagination, and the materiality of sense,
  neither using reason, nor imagination, nor senses, but as it were
  formally beholding all things with that one twinkling of the mind.
  Likewise reason, when it considereth any universality, comprehendeth
  both imagination and sensible things without the use of either
  imagination or senses. For she defineth the universality of her conceit
  thus: Man is a reasonable, two-footed, living creature, which being an
  universal knowledge, no man is ignorant that it is an imaginable and
  sensible thing, which she considereth by a reasonable conceiving and not
  by imagination or sense. Imagination also, although it began by the
  senses of seeing and forming figures, yet when sense is absent it
  beholdeth sensible things, not after a sensible, but after an imaginary
  manner of knowledge. Seest thou now how all these in knowing do rather
  use their own force and faculty than the force of those things which are
  known? Nor undeservedly; for since all judgment is the act of him who
  judgeth, it is necessary that every one should perfect his operation by
  his own power and not by the force of any other.</p>

<p id="id00908" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  And if in sentient bodies, although the qualities of outward objects do
  move the organs of sense, and the passion of the body goeth before the
  vigour of the active mind, provoking her action to itself and exciting
  the inward forms which before lay quiet; if, I say, in perceiving these
  corporal objects the mind taketh not her impression from passion, but by
  her own force judgeth of the passion itself, which is objected to the
  body; how much more do those powers exercise the action of their mind
  and not only follow the outward objects in their judgment, which are
  free from all affections of the body? Wherefore in this sort have
  diverse and different substances knowledges of many kinds. For only
  sense destitute of all other means of knowledge is in those living
  creatures which are unmovable, as some shell-fish and other which stick
  to stones and so are nourished; and imagination in movable beasts who
  seem to have some power to covet and fly. But reason belongeth only to
  mankind, as understanding to things divine. So that that knowledge is
  most excellent which of itself doth not only know her own object, but
  also those which belong to others. What then, if sense and imagination
  repugn to discourse and reason, affirming that universality to be
  nothing which reason thinketh herself to see? For that cannot be
  universal, they argue, which is either sensible or imaginable; wherefore
  either the judgment of reason must be true and nothing at all sensible,
  or because they know that many things are subject to the senses and
  imagination, the conceit of reason is vain, which considereth that which
  is sensible and singular as if it were universal. Moreover if reason
  should answer that she beholdeth in her universality all that which is
  sensible or imaginable, but they cannot aspire to the knowledge of
  universality, because their knowledge cannot surpass corporal figures
  and shapes, and that we must give more credit to the firmer and more
  perfect judgment about the knowledge of things, in this contention
  should not we, who have the power of discoursing as well as of
  imagination and sense, rather take reason's part? The very like
  happeneth when human reason doth not think that the divine understanding
  doth behold future things otherwise than she herself doth. For thus thou
  arguest: If any things seem not to have certain and necessary events,
  they cannot be certainly foreknown to be to come. Wherefore there is no
  foreknowledge of these things, and if we think that there is any, there
  shall be nothing which happeneth not of necessity. If, therefore, as we
  are endued with reason, we could likewise have the judgment proper to
  the divine mind, as we have judged that imagination and sense must yield
  to reason, so likewise we would think it most reasonable and just that
  human reason should submit herself to the divine mind. Wherefore let us
  be lifted up as much as we can to that height of the highest mind; for
  there reason shall see that which she cannot behold in herself. And that
  is, how a certain and definite foreknowledge seeth even those things
  which have no certain issue, and that this is no opinion, but rather the
  simplicity of the highest knowledge enclosed within no bounds.</p>

<p id="id00914">Quoniam igitur, uti paulo ante monstratum est, omne quod scitur non ex sua
sed ex conprehendentium natura cognoscitur, intueamur nunc quantum fas est,
quis sit diuinae substantiae status, ut quaenam etiam scientia eius sit,
possimus agnoscere. Deum igitur aeternum esse cunctorum ratione degentium
commune iudicium est. Quid sit igitur aeternitas consideremus; haec enim
nobis naturam pariter diuinam scientiamque patefacit. Aeternitas igitur est
interminabilis uitae tota simul et perfecta possessio, quod ex collatione
temporalium clarius liquet. Nam quidquid uiuit in tempore id praesens a
praeteritis in futura procedit nihilque est in tempore constitutum quod
totum uitae suae spatium pariter possit amplecti. Sed crastinum quidem
nondum adprehendit; hesternum uero iam perdidit; in hodierna quoque uita
non amplius uiuitis quam in illo mobili transitorioque momento. Quod igitur
temporis patitur condicionem, licet illud, sicuti de mundo censuit
Aristoteles, nec coeperit umquam esse nec desinat uitaque eius cum temporis
infinitate tendatur, nondum tamen tale est ut aeternum esse iure credatur.
Non enim totum simul infinitae licet uitae spatium comprehendit atque
complectitur, sed futura nondum transacta iam non habet. Quod igitur
interminabilis uitae plenitudinem totam pariter comprehendit ac possidet,
cui neque futuri quidquam absit nec praeteriti fluxerit, id aeternum esse
iure perhibetur, idque necesse est et sui compos praesens sibi semper
adsistere et infinitatem mobilis temporis habere praesentem. Vnde non recte
quidam, qui cum audiunt uisum Platoni mundum hunc nec habuisse initium
temporis nec habiturum esse defectum, hoc modo conditori conditum mundum
fieri coaeternum putant. Aliud est enim per interminabilem duci uitam, quod
mundo Plato tribuit, aliud interminabilis uitae totam pariter complexum
esse praesentiam, quod diuinae mentis proprium esse manifestum est. Neque
deus conditis rebus antiquior uideri debet temporis quantitate sed
simplicis potius proprietate naturae. Hunc enim uitae immobilis
praesentarium statum infinitus ille temporalium rerum motus imitatur cumque
eum effingere atque aequare non possit, ex immobilitate deficit in motum,
ex simplicitate praesentiae decrescit in infinitam futuri ac praeteriti
quantitatem; et cum totam pariter uitae suae plenitudinem nequeat
possidere, hoc ipso quod aliquo modo numquam esse desinit; illud quod
implere atque exprimere non potest, aliquatenus uidetur aemulari alligans
se ad qualemcumque praesentiam huius exigui uolucrisque momenti, quae,
quoniam manentis illius praesentiae quandam gestat imaginem, quibuscumque
contigerit id praestat ut esse uideantur. Quoniam uero manere non potuit,
infinitum temporis iter arripuit eoque modo factum est ut continuaret eundo
uitam cuius plenitudinem complecti non ualuit permanendo. Itaque si digna
rebus nomina uelimus imponere, Platonem sequentes deum quidem aeternum,
mundum uero dicamus esse perpetuum. Quoniam igitur omne iudicium secundum
sui naturam quae sibi subiecta sunt comprehendit, est autem deo semper
aeternus ac praesentarius status; scientia quoque eius omnem temporis
supergressa motionem in suae manet simplicitate praesentiae infinitaque
praeteriti ac futuri spatia complectens omnia quasi iam gerantur in sua
simplici cognitione considerat. Itaque si praesentiam pensare uelis qua
cuncta dinoscit, non esse praescientiam quasi futuri sed scientiam numquam
deficientis instantiae rectius aestimabis; unde non praeuidentia sed
prouidentia potius dicitur, quod porro ab rebus infimis constituta quasi ab
excelso rerum cacumine cuncta prospiciat. Quid igitur postulas ut
necessaria fiant quae diuino lumine lustrentur, cum ne homines quidem
necessaria faciant esse quae uideant? Num enim quae praesentia cernis,
aliquam eis necessitatem tuus addit intuitus?" "Minime." "Atqui si est
diuini humanique praesentis digna collatio, uti uos uestro hoc temporario
praesenti quaedam uidetis, ita ille omnia suo cernit aeterno. Quare haec
diuina praenotio naturam rerum proprietatemque non mutat taliaque apud se
praesentia spectat qualia in tempore olim futura prouenient. Nec rerum
iudicia confundit unoque suae mentis intuitu tam necessarie quam non
necessarie uentura dinoscit; sicuti uos cum pariter ambulare in terra
hominem et oriri in caelo solem uidetis, quamquam simul utrumque conspectum
tamen discernitis et hoc uoluntarium illud esse necessarium iudicatis, ita
igitur cuncta despiciens diuinus intuitus qualitatem rerum minime perturbat
apud se quidem praesentium, ad condicionem uero temporis futurarum. Quo fit
ut hoc non sit opinio sed ueritate potius nixa cognitio, cum exstaturum
quid esse cognoscit quod idem exsistendi necessitate carere non nesciat.
Hic si dicas quod euenturum deus uidet id non euenire non posse, quod autem
non potest non euenire id ex necessitate contingere, meque ad hoc nomen
necessitatis adstringas; fatebor rem quidem solidissimae ueritatis sed cui
uix aliquis nisi diuini speculator accesserit. Respondebo namque idem
futurum, cum ad diuinam notionem refertur, necessarium, cum uero in sua
natura perpenditur, liberum prorsus atque absolutum uideri. Duae sunt
etenim necessitates, simplex una, ueluti quod necesse est omnes homines
esse mortales, altera condicionis, ut si aliquem ambulare scias, eum
ambulare necesse est; quod enim quisque nouit, id esse aliter ac notum est
nequit, sed haec condicio minime secum illam simplicem trahit. Hanc enim
necessitatem non propria facit natura sed condicionis adiectio; nulla enim
necessitas cogit incedere uoluntate gradientem, quamuis eum tum cum
graditur incedere necessarium sit. Eodem igitur modo, si quid prouidentia
praesens uidet, id esse necesse est, tametsi nullam naturae habeat
necessitatem. Atqui deus ea futura quae ex arbitrii libertate proueniunt
praesentia contuetur. Haec igitur ad intuitum relata diuinum necessaria
fiant per condicionem diuinae notionis; per se uero considerata ab absoluta
naturae suae libertate non desinunt. Fient igitur procul dubio cuncta quae
futura deus esse praenoscit, sed eorum quaedam de libero proficiscuntur
arbitrio; quae quamuis eueniant, exsistendo tamen naturam propriam non
amittunt, qua priusquam fierent etiam non euenire potuissent. Quid igitur
refert non esse necessaria, cum propter diuinae scientiae condicionem modis
omnibus necessitatis instar eueniet? Hoc scilicet quod ea quae paulo ante
proposui, sol oriens et gradiens homo. Quae dum fiunt, non fieri non
possunt; eorum tamen unum prius quoque quam fieret, necesse erat exsistere,
alterum uero minime. Ita etiam quae praesentia deus habet, dubio procul
exsistent, sed eorum hoc quidem de rerum necessitate descendit, illud uero
de potestate facientium. Haud igitur iniuria diximus haec si ad diuinam
notitiam referantur necessaria, si per se considerentur necessitatis esse
nexibus absoluta; sicuti omne quod sensibus patet, si ad rationem referas,
uniuersale est, si ad se ipsa respicias, singulare. 'Sed si in mea,'
inquies, 'potestate situm est mutare propositum, euacuabo prouidentiam, cum
quae illa praenoscit forte mutauero.' Respondebo: propositum te quidem tuum
posse deflectere, sed quoniam et id te posse et an facias quoue conuertas
praesens prouidentiae ueritas intuetur, diuinam te praescientiam non posse
uitare, sicuti praesentis oculi effugere non possis intuitum, quamuis te in
uarias actiones libera uoluntate conuerteris. Quid igitur inquies? Ex meane
dispositione scientia diuina mutabitur, ut cum ego nunc hoc nunc aliud
uelim, illa quoque noscendi uices alternare uideatur? Minime. Omne namque
futurum diuinus praecurrit intuitus et ad praesentiam propriae cognitionis
retorquet ac reuocat nec alternat, ut aestimas, nunc hoc nunc illud
praenoscendi uice, sed uno ictu mutationes tuas manens praeuenit atque
complectitur. Quam comprehendendi omnia uisendique praesentiam non ex
futurarum prouentu rerum, sed ex propria deus simplicitate sortitus est. Ex
quo illud quoque resoluitur quod paulo ante posuisti indignum esse, si
scientiae dei causam futura nostra praestare dicantur. Haec enim scientiae
uis praesentaria notione cuncta complectens rebus modum omnibus ipsa
constituit, nihil uero posterioribus debet. Quae cum ita sint, manet
intemerata mortalibus arbitrii libertas nec iniquae leges solutis omni
necessitate uoluntatibus praemia poenasque proponunt. Manet etiam spectator
desuper cunctorum praescius deus uisionisque eius praesens semper
aeternitas cum nostrorum actuum futura qualitate concurrit bonis praemia
malis supplicia dispensans. Nec frustra sunt in deo positae spes precesque;
quae cum rectae sunt, inefficaces esse non possunt. Auersamini igitur
uitia, colite uirtutes, ad rectas spes animum subleuate, humiles preces in
excelsa porrigite. Magna uobis est, si dissimulare non uultis, necessitas
indicta probitatis, cum ante oculos agitis iudicis cuncta cernentis."</p>

<h2 id="id00915" style="margin-top: 4em">  VI.</h2>

<p id="id00916" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Seeing, therefore, as hath been showed, all that is known is not
  comprehended by its own nature but by the power of him which
  comprehendeth it, let us see now, as much as we may, what is the state
  of the divine substance that we may also know what His knowledge is.
  Wherefore it is the common judgment of all that live by reason that God
  is everlasting, and therefore let us consider what eternity is. For this
  declareth unto us both the divine nature and knowledge. Eternity
  therefore is a perfect possession altogether of an endless life, which
  is more manifest by the comparison of temporal things, for whatsoever
  liveth in time, that being present proceedeth from times past to times
  to come, and there is nothing placed in time which can embrace all the
  space of its life at once. But it hath not yet attained to-morrow and
  hath lost yesterday. And you live no more in this day's life than in
  that movable and transitory moment. Wherefore, whatsoever suffereth the
  condition of time, although, as Aristotle thought of the world, it never
  began nor were ever to end, and its life did endure with infinite time,
  yet it is not such that it ought to be called everlasting. For it doth
  not comprehend and embrace all the space of its life together, though
  that life be infinite, but it hath not the future time which is yet to
  come. That then which comprehendeth and possesseth the whole fulness of
  an endless life together, to which neither any part to come is absent,
  nor of that which is past hath escaped, is worthy to be accounted
  everlasting, and this is necessary, that being no possession in itself,
  it may always be present to itself, and have an infinity of movable time
  present to it. Wherefore they are deceived who, hearing that Plato
  thought that this world had neither beginning of time nor should ever
  have any end, think that by this means the created world should be
  coeternal with the Creator. For it is one thing to be carried through an
  endless life, which Plato attributed to the world, another thing to
  embrace the whole presence of an endless life together, which is
  manifestly proper to the divine mind. Neither ought God to seem more
  ancient than the things created, by the quantity of time, but rather by
  the simplicity of His divine nature. For that infinite motion of
  temporal things imitateth the present state of the unmovable life, and
  since it cannot express nor equal it, it falleth from immobility to
  motion, and from the simplicity of presence, it decreaseth to an
  infinite quantity of future and past, and since it cannot possess
  together all the fulness of its life, by never leaving to be in some
  sort, it seemeth to emulate in part that which it cannot fully obtain
  and express, tying itself to this small presence of this short and swift
  moment, which because it carrieth a certain image of that abiding
  presence, whosoever hath it, seemeth to be. But because it could not
  stay it undertook an infinite journey of time, and so it came to pass
  that it continued that life by going whose plenitude it could not
  comprehend by staying. Wherefore, if we will give things their right
  names, following Plato, let us say that God is everlasting and the world
  perpetual. Wherefore, since every judgment comprehendeth those things
  which are subject unto it, according to its own nature, and God hath
  always an everlasting and present state, His knowledge also surpassing
  all motions of time, remaineth in the simplicity of His presence, and
  comprehending the infinite spaces of that which is past and to come,
  considereth all things in His simple knowledge as though they were now
  in doing. So that, if thou wilt weigh His foreknowledge with which He
  discerneth all things, thou wilt more rightly esteem it to be the
  knowledge of a never fading instant than a foreknowledge as of a thing
  to come. For which cause it is not called praevidence or foresight, but
  rather providence, because, placed far from inferior things, it
  overlooketh all things, as it were, from the highest top of things. Why,
  therefore, wilt thou have those things necessary which are illustrated
  by the divine light, since that not even men make not those things
  necessary which they see? For doth thy sight impose any necessity upon
  those things which thou seest present?" "No." "But the present instant
  of men may well be compared to that of God in this: that as you see some
  things in your temporal instant, so He beholdeth all things in His
  eternal present. Wherefore this divine foreknowledge doth not change the
  nature and propriety of things, and it beholdeth them such in His
  presence as they will after come to be, neither doth He confound the
  judgment of things, and with one sight of His mind He discerneth as well
  those things which shall happen necessarily as otherwise. As you, when
  at one time you see a man walking upon the earth and the sun rising in
  heaven, although they be both seen at once, yet you discern and judge
  that the one is voluntary, and the other necessary, so likewise the
  divine sight beholding all things disturbeth not the quality of things
  which to Him are present, but in respect of time are yet to come. And so
  this is not an opinion but rather a knowledge grounded upon truth, when
  He knoweth that such a thing shall be, which likewise He is not ignorant
  that it hath no necessity of being. Here if thou sayest that cannot
  choose but happen which God seeth shall happen, and that which cannot
  choose but happen, must be of necessity, and so tiest me to this name of
  necessity, I will grant that it is a most solid truth, but whereof
  scarce any but a contemplator of divinity is capable. For I will answer
  that the same thing is necessary when it is referred to the Divine
  knowledge; but when it is weighed in its own nature that it seemeth
  altogether free and absolute. For there be two necessities: the one
  simple, as that it is necessary for all men to be mortal; the other
  conditional, as if thou knowest that any man walketh, he must needs
  walk. For what a man knoweth cannot be otherwise than it is known. But
  this conditional draweth not with it that simple or absolute necessity.
  For this is not caused by the nature of the thing, but by the adding a
  condition. For no necessity maketh him to go that goeth of his own
  accord, although it be necessary that he goeth while he goeth. In like
  manner, if providence seeth anything present, that must needs be,
  although it hath no necessity of nature. But God beholdeth those future
  things, which proceed from free-will, present. These things, therefore,
  being referred to the divine sight are necessary by the condition of the
  divine knowledge, and, considered by themselves, they lose not absolute
  freedom of their own nature. Wherefore doubtless all those things come
  to pass which God foreknoweth shall come, but some of them proceed from
  free-will, which though they come to pass, yet do not, by coining into
  being, lose, since before they came to pass, they might also not have
  happened. But what importeth it that they are not necessary, since that
  by reason of the condition of the divine knowledge they come to pass in
  all respects as if they were necessary? It hath the same import as those
  things which I proposed a little before—the sun rising and the man
  going. While they are in doing, they cannot choose but be in doing; yet
  one of them was necessarily to be before it was, and the other not.
  Likewise those things which God hath present, will have doubtless a
  being, but some of them proceed from the necessity of things, other from
  the power of the doers. And therefore we said not without cause that
  these, if they be referred to God's knowledge, are necessary; and if
  they be considered by themselves, they are free from the bonds of
  necessity. As whatsoever is manifest to senses, if thou referrest it to
  reason, is universal; if thou considerest the things themselves, it is
  singular or particular. But thou wilt say, 'If it is in my power to
  change my purpose, shall I frustrate providence if I chance to alter
  those things which she foreknoweth?' I answer that thou mayest indeed
  change thy purpose, but because the truth of providence, being present,
  seeth that thou canst do so, and whether thou wilt do so or no, and what
  thou purposest anew, thou canst not avoid the divine foreknowledge, even
  as thou canst not avoid the sight of an eye which is present, although
  thou turnest thyself to divers actions by thy free-will.</p>

<p id="id00917" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But yet thou wilt inquire whether God's knowledge shall be changed by
  thy disposition, so that when thou wilt now one thing, and now another,
  it should also seem to have divers knowledges. No. For God's sight
  preventeth all that is to come and recalleth and draweth it to the
  presence of His own knowledge; neither doth He vary, as thou imaginest,
  now knowing one thing and now another, but in one instant without moving
  preventeth and comprehendeth thy mutations. Which presence of
  comprehending and seeing all things, God hath not by the event of future
  things but by His own simplicity. By which that doubt is also resolved
  which thou didst put a little before, that it is an unworthy thing that
  our future actions should be said to cause the knowledge of God. For
  this force of the divine knowledge comprehending all things with a
  present notion appointeth to everything its measure and receiveth
  nothing from ensuing accidents. All which being so, the free-will of
  mortal men remaineth unviolated, neither are the laws unjust which
  propose punishments and rewards to our wills, which are free from all
  necessity. There remaineth also a beholder of all things which is God,
  who foreseeth all things, and the eternity of His vision, which is
  always present, concurreth with the future quality of our actions,
  distributing rewards to the good and punishments to the evil. Neither do
  we in vain put our hope in God or pray to Him; for if we do this well
  and as we ought, we shall not lose our labour or be without effect.
  Wherefore fly vices, embrace virtues, possess your minds with worthy
  hopes, offer up humble prayers to your highest Prince. There is, if you
  will not dissemble, a great necessity of doing well imposed upon you,
  since you live in the sight of your Judge, who beholdeth all things."</p>
