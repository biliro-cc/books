<p id="id00330">Restat ut, quemadmodum catholica fides dicat, et in utrisque naturis<br/>

Christum et ex utrisque consistere doceamus.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00331">Ex utrisque naturis aliquid consistere duo significat: unum quidem, cum ita
dicimus aliquid ex duabus naturis iungi sicut ex melle atque aqua, id autem
est ut ex quolibet modo confusis, uel si una uertatur in alteram uel si
utraeque in se inuicem misceantur, nullo modo tamen utraeque permaneant;
secundum hunc modum Eutyches ait ex utrisque naturis Christum consistere.</p>

<p id="id00332">Alter uero modus est ex utrisque consistendi quod ita ex duabus iunctum
est, ut illa tamen ex quibus iunctum esse dicitur maneant nec in alterutra
uertantur, ut cum dicimus coronam ex auro gemmisque compositam. Hic neque
aurum in gemmas translatum est neque in aurum gemma conuersa, sed utraque
permanent nec formam propriam derelinquunt. Talia ergo ex aliquibus
constantia et in his constare dicimus ex quibus consistere praedicantur.
Tunc enim possumus dicere coronam gemmis auroque consistere; sunt enim
gemmae atque aurum in quibus corona consistat. Nam in priore modo non est
mel atque aqua in quibus illud quod ex utrisque iungitur constet. Cum
igitur utrasque manere naturas in Christo fides catholica confiteatur
perfectasque easdem persistere nec alteram in alteram transmutari, iure
dicit et in utrisque naturis Christum et ex utrisque consistere: in
utrisque quidem, quia manent utraeque, ex utrisque uero, quia utrarumque
adunatione manentium una persona fit Christi. Non autem secundum eam
significationem ex utrisque naturis Christum iunctum esse fides catholica
tenet, secundum quam Eutyches pronuntiat. Nam ille talem significationem
coniunctionis ex utraque natura sumit, ut non confiteatur in utrisque
consistere, neque enim utrasque manere; catholicus uero eam significationem
ex utrisque consistendi sumit quae illi sit proxima eamque conseruet quae
in utrisque consistere confitetur.</p>

<p id="id00333">Aequiuocum igitur est "ex utrisque consistere" ac potius amphibolum et
gemina significatione diuersa designans: una quidem significatione non
manere substantias ex quibus illud quod copulatum est dicatur esse
coniunctum, alio modo significans ita ex utrisque coniunctum, ut utraque
permaneant.</p>

<p id="id00334">Hoc igitur expedito aequiuocationis atque ambiguitatis nodo nihil est ultra
quod possit opponi, quin id sit quod firma ueraque fides catholica
continet; eundem Christum hominem esse perfectum, eundem deum eundemque qui
homo sit perfectus atque deus unum esse deum ac dei filium, nec
quaternitatem trinitati adstrui, dum homo additur supra perfectum deum, sed
unam eandemque personam numerum trinitatis explere, ut cum humanitas passa
sit, deus tamen passus esse dicatur, non quo ipsa deitas humanitas facta
sit, sed quod a deitate fuerit adsumpta. Item qui homo est, dei filius
appellatur non substantia diuinitatis sed humanitatis, quae tamen
diuinitati naturali unitate coniuncta est. Et cum haec ita intellegentia
discernantur permisceanturque, tamen unus idemque et homo sit perfectus et
deus: deus quidem, quod ipse sit ex patris substantia genitus, homo uero,
quod ex Maria sit uirgine procreatus. Itemque qui homo, deus eo quod a deo
fuerit adsumptus, et qui deus, homo, quoniam uestitus homine sit. Cumque in
eadem persona aliud sit diuinitas quae suscepit, aliud quam suscepit
humanitas, idem tamen deus atque homo est. Nam si hominem intellegas, idem
homo est atque deus, quoniam homo ex natura, deus adsumptione. Si uero deum
intellegas, idem deus est atque homo, quoniam natura deus est, homo
adsumptione. Fitque in eo gemina natura geminaque substantia, quoniam homo-
deus unaque persona, quoniam idem homo atque deus. Mediaque est haec inter
duas haereses uia sicut uirtutes quoque medium tenent. Omnis enim uirtus in
medio rerum decore locata consistit. Siquid enim uel ultra uel infra quam
oportuerit fiat, a uirtute disceditur. Medietatem igitur uirtus tenet.</p>

<p id="id00335">Quocirca si quattuor haec neque ultra neque infra esse possunt, ut in
Christo aut duae naturae sint duaeque personae ut Nestorius ait, aut una
persona unaque natura ut Eutyches ait, aut duae naturae sed una persona ut
catholica fides credit, aut una natura duaeque personae,[73] cumque duas
quidem naturas duasque personas in ea quae contra Nestorium dicta est
responsione conuicerimus (unam uero personam unamque naturam esse non posse
Eutyche proponente monstrauimus neque tamen tam amens quisquam huc usque
exstitit, ut unam in eo naturam crederet sed geminas esse personas), restat
ut ea sit uera quam fides catholica pronuntiat geminam substantiam sed unam
esse personam. Quia uero paulo ante diximus Eutychen confiteri duas quidem
in Christo ante adunationem naturas, unam uero post adunationem, cumque
hunc errorem duplicem interpretaremur celare sententiam, ut haec adunatio
aut generatione fieret, cum ex Maria corpus hominis minime sumeretur aut ad
sumptum[74] quidem ex Maria per resurrectionem fieret adunatio, de utrisque
quidem partibus idonee ut arbitror disputatum est. Nunc quaerendum est
quomodo fieri potuerit ut duae naturae in unam substantiam miscerentur.</p>

<h2 id="id00338" style="margin-top: 4em">  VII.</h2>

<p id="id00339">  It remains for us to show how in accordance with the affirmation of<br/>

  Catholic belief Christ consists at once in and of both natures.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00340" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The statement that a thing consists of two natures bears two meanings;
  one, when we say that anything is a union of two natures, as e.g. honey
  and water, where the union is such that in the combination, however the
  elements be confounded, whether by one nature changing into the other,
  or by both mingling with each other, the two entirely disappear. This is
  the way in which according to Eutyches Christ consists of two natures.</p>

<p id="id00341" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The other way in which a thing can consist of two natures is when it is
  so combined of two that the elements of which it is said to be combined
  continue without changing into each other, as when we say that a crown
  is composed of gold and gems. Here neither is the gold converted into
  gems nor is the gem turned into gold, but both continue without
  surrendering their proper form.</p>

<p id="id00342" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Things then like this, composed of various elements, we say consist also
  in the elements of which they are composed. For in this case we can say
  that a crown is composed of gems and gold, for gems and gold are that in
  which the crown consists. For in the former mode of composition honey
  and water is not that in which the resulting union of both consists.</p>

<p id="id00343" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Since then the Catholic Faith confesses that both natures continue in
  Christ and that they both remain perfect, neither being transformed into
  the other, it says with right that Christ consists both in and of the
  two natures; <i>in</i> the two because both continue, <i>of</i> the two
  because the One Person of Christ is formed by the union of the two
  continuing natures.</p>

<p id="id00344" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But the Catholic Faith does not hold the union of Christ out of two
  natures according to that sense which Eutyches puts upon it. For the
  interpretation of the conjunction out of two natures which he adopts
  forbids him to confess consistence in two or the continuance of the two
  either; but the Catholic adopts an interpretation of the consistence out
  of two which comes near to that of Eutyches, yet keeps the
  interpretation which confesses consistence in two.</p>

<p id="id00345" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  "To consist of two natures" is therefore an equivocal or rather a
  doubtful term of double meaning denoting different things; according to
  one of its interpretations the substances out of which the union is said
  to have been composed do not continue, according to another the union
  effected of the two is such that both natures continue.</p>

<p id="id00346" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  When once this knot of doubt or ambiguity has been untied, nothing
  further can be advanced to shake the true and solid content of the
  Catholic Faith, which is that the same Christ is perfect man and God,
  and that He who is perfect man and God is One God and Son of Man, that,
  however, quaternity is not added to the Trinity by the addition of human
  nature to perfect Godhead, but that one and the same Person completes
  the number of the Trinity, so that, although it was the manhood which
  suffered, yet God can be said to have suffered, not by manhood becoming
  Godhead but by manhood being assumed by Godhead. Further, He who is man
  is called Son of God not in virtue of divine but of human substance,
  which latter none the less was conjoined to Godhead in a unity of
  natures. And although thought is able to distinguish and combine the
  manhood and the Godhead, yet one and the same is perfect man and God,
  God because He was begotten of the substance of the Father, but man
  because He was engendered of the Virgin Mary. And further He who is man
  is God in that manhood was assumed by God, and He who is God is man in
  that God was clothed with manhood. And although in the same Person the
  Godhead which took manhood is different from the manhood which It took,
  yet the same is God and man. For if you think of man, the same is man
  and God, being man by nature, God by assumption. But if you think of
  God, the same is God and man, being God by nature, man by assumption.
  And in Him nature becomes double and substance double because He is God-
  man, and One Person since the same is man and God. This is the middle
  way between two heresies, just as virtues also hold a middle place.[75]
  For every virtue has a place of honour midway between extremes. For if
  it stands beyond or below where it should it ceases to be virtue. And so
  virtue holds a middle place.</p>

<p id="id00347" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Wherefore if the following four assertions can be said to be neither
  beyond or below reason, viz. that in Christ are either two Natures and
  two Persons as Nestorius says, or one Person and one Nature as Eutyches
  says, or two Natures but one Person as the Catholic Faith believes, or
  one Nature and two Persons, and inasmuch as we have refuted the doctrine
  of two Natures and two Persons in our argument against Nestorius and
  incidentally have shown that the one Person and one Nature suggested by
  Eutyches is impossible—since there has never been anyone so mad as to
  believe that His Nature was single but His Person double—it remains
  that the article of belief must be true which the Catholic Faith
  affirms, viz. that the Nature is double, but the Person one. But as I
  have just now remarked that Eutyches confesses two Natures in Christ
  before the union, but only one after the union, and since I proved that
  under this error lurked two opposite opinions, one, that the union was
  brought about by conception although the human body was certainly not
  taken from Mary; the other, that the body taken from Mary formed part of
  the union by means of the Resurrection, I have, it seems to me, argued
  the twofold aspect of the case as completely as it deserves. What we
  have now to inquire is how it came to pass that two Natures were
  combined into one Substance.</p>

<h2 id="id00349" style="margin-top: 4em">VIII.</h2>

<p id="id00350">Verumtamen est etiam nunc et alia quaestio quae ab his inferri potest qui
corpus humanum ex Maria sumptum esse non credunt, sed alias fuisse
sequestratum praeparatumque quod in adunatione ex Mariae utero gigni ac
proferri uideretur. Aiunt enim: si ex homine sumptum est corpus, homo uero
omnis ex prima praeuaricatione non solum peccato et morte tenebatur, uerum
etiam affectibus peccatorum erat implicitus, eaque illi fuit poena peccati,
ut, cum morte teneretur obstrictus, tamen esset reus etiam uoluntate
peccandi, cur in Christo neque peccatum fuit neque uoluntas ulla peccandi?
Et omnino habet animaduertendam dubitationem talis quaestio. Si enim ex
carne humana Christi corpus adsumptum est, dubitari potest, quaenam caro
haec quae adsumpta sit esse uideatur. Eum quippe saluauit quem etiam
adsumpsit; sin uero talem hominem adsumpsit qualis Adam fuit ante peccatum,
integram quidem uidetur humanam adsumpsisse naturam, sed tamen quae
medicina penitus non egebat. Quomodo autem fieri potest, ut talem
adsumpserit hominem qualis Adam fuit, cum in Adam potuerit esse peccandi
uoluntas atque affectio, unde factum est ut etiam praetergressis diuinis
praeceptis inoboedientiae delictis teneretur adstrictus? In Christo uero ne
uoluntas quidem ulla creditur fuisse peccandi, cum praesertim si tale
corpus hominis adsumpsit quale Adae ante peccatum fuit, non debuerit esse
mortalis, quoniam Adam, si non peccasset, mortem nulla ratione sensisset.
Cum igitur Christus non peccauerit, quaerendum est cur senserit mortem, si
Adae corpus ante quam peccaret adsumpsit. Quod si talem statum suscepit
hominis qualis Adae post peccatum fuit, uidetur etiam Christo non defuisse
necessitas, ut et delictis subiceretur et passionibus confunderetur
obductisque iudicii regulis bonum a malo non sincera integritate
discerneret, quoniam has omnes poenas Adam delicti praeuaricatione
suscepit.</p>

<p id="id00351">Contra quos respondendum est tres intellegi hominum posse status: unum
quidem Adae ante delictum in quo, tametsi ab eo mors aberat nec adhuc ullo
se delicto polluerat, poterat tamen in eo uoluntas esse peccandi: alter in
quo mutari potuisset, si firmiter in dei praeceptis manere uoluisset, tunc
enim id addendum foret ut non modo non peccaret aut peccare uellet sed ne
posset quidem aut peccare aut uelle delinquere. Tertius status est post
delictum in quo mors illum necessario subsecuta est et peccatum ipsum
uoluntasque peccati. Quorum summitatum atque contrariorum haec loca sunt:
is status qui praemium esset, si in praeceptis dei Adam manere uoluisset et
is qui poenae fuit, quoniam manere noluit; in illo enim nec mors esset nec
peccatum nec uoluntas ulla peccati, in hoc uero et mors et peccatum et
delinquendi omnis affectio omniaque in perniciem prona nec quicquam in se
opis habentia, ut post lapsum posset adsurgere. Ille uero medius status in
quo praesentia quidem mortis uel peccati aberat, potestas uero utriusque
constabat, inter utrumque statum est conlocatus. Ex his igitur tribus
statibus Christus corporeae naturae singulas quodam modo indidit causas;
nam quod mortale corpus adsumpsit ut mortem a genere humano fugaret, in eo
statu ponendum est quod post Adae praeuaricationem poenaliter inflictum
est. Quod uero non fuit in eo uoluntas ulla peccati, ex eo sumptum est
statu qui esse potuisset, nisi uoluntatem insidiantis fraudibus
applicasset. Restat igitur tertius status id est medius, ille scilicet qui
eo tempore fuit, cum nec mors aderat et adesse poterat delinquendi
uoluntas. In hoc igitur Adam talis fuit ut manducaret ac biberet, ut
accepta digereret, ut laberetur in somnum et alia quae ei non defuerunt
humana quidem sed concessa et quae nullam poenam mortis inferrent.</p>

<p id="id00352">Quae omnia habuisse Christum dubium non est; nam et manducauit et bibit et
humani corporis officio functus est. Neque enim tanta indigentia in Adam
fuisse credenda est ut nisi manducasset uiuere non potuisset, sed, si ex
omni quidem ligno escam sumeret, semper uiuere potuisset hisque non mori;
idcirco paradisi fructibus indigentiam explebat. Quam indigentiam fuisse in
Christo nullus ignorat, sed potestate non necessitate; et ipsa indigentia
ante resurrectionem in eo fuit, post resurrectionem uero talis exstitit ut
ita illud corpus inmutaretur humanum, sicut Adae praeter praeuaricationis
uinculum mutari potuisset. Quodque nos ipse dominus Iesus Christus uotis
docuit optare, ut fiat uoluntas eius sicut in caelo et in terra et ut
adueniat eius regnum et nos liberet a malo. Haec enim omnia illa beatissima
humani generis fideliter credentium inmutatio deprecatur.</p>

<p id="id00353">Haec sunt quae ad te de fidei meae credulitate scripsi. Qua in re si quid
perperam dictum est, non ita sum amator mei, ut ea quae semel effuderim
meliori sententiae anteferre contendam. Si enim nihil est ex nobis boni,
nihil est quod in nostris sententiis amare debeamus. Quod si ex illo cuncta
sunt bona qui solus est bonus, illud potius bonum esse credendum est quod
illa incommutabilis bonitas atque omnium bonorum causa perscribit.</p>

<h2 id="id00354" style="margin-top: 4em">  VIII.</h2>

<p id="id00355" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Nevertheless there remains yet another question which can be advanced by
  those who do not believe that the human body was taken from Mary, but
  that the body was in some other way set apart and prepared, which in the
  moment of union appeared to be conceived and born of Mary's womb. For
  they say: if the body was taken from man while every man was, from the
  time of the first disobedience, not only enslaved by sin and death but
  also involved in sinful desires, and if his punishment for sin was that,
  although he was held in chains of death, yet at the same time he should
  be guilty because of the will to sin, why was there in Christ neither
  sin nor any will to sin? And certainly such a question is attended by a
  difficulty which deserves attention. For if the body of Christ was
  assumed from human flesh, it is open to doubt of what kind we must
  consider that flesh to be which was assumed.</p>

<p id="id00356" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  In truth, the manhood which He assumed He likewise saved; but if He
  assumed such manhood as Adam had before sin, He appears to have assumed
  a human nature complete indeed, but one which was in no need of healing.
  But how can it be that He assumed such manhood as Adam had when there
  could be in Adam both the will and the desire to sin, whence it came to
  pass that even after the divine commands had been broken, he was still
  held captive to sins of disobedience? But we believe that in Christ
  there was never any will to sin, because especially if He assumed such a
  human body as Adam had before his sin, He could not be mortal, since
  Adam, had he not sinned, would in no wise have suffered death. Since,
  then, Christ never sinned, it must be asked why He suffered death if He
  assumed the body of Adam before sin. But if He accepted human conditions
  such as Adam's were after sin, it seems that Christ could not avoid
  being subject to sin, perplexed by passions, and, since the canons of
  judgment were obscured, prevented from distinguishing with unclouded
  reason between good and evil, since Adam by his disobedience incurred
  all these penalties of crime.</p>

<p id="id00357" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  To whom we must reply[76] that there are three states of man to
  envisage: one, that of Adam before his sin, in which, though free from
  death and still unstained by any sin, he could yet have within him the
  will to sin; the second, that in which he might have suffered change had
  he chosen to abide steadfastly in the commands of God, for then it could
  have been further granted him not only not to sin or wish to sin, but to
  be incapable of sinning or of the will to transgress. The third state is
  the state after sin, into which man needs must be pursued by death and
  sin and the sinful will. Now the points of extreme divergence between
  these states are the following: one state would have been for Adam a
  reward if he had chosen to abide in God's laws; the other was his
  punishment because he would not abide in them; for in the former state
  there would have been no death nor sin nor sinful will, in the latter
  there was both death and sin and every desire to transgress, and a
  general tendency to ruin and a condition helpless to render possible a
  rise after the Fall. But that middle state from which actual death or
  sin was absent, but the power for both remained, is situate between the
  other two.</p>

<p id="id00358" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Each one, then, of these three states somehow supplied to Christ a cause
  for his corporeal nature; thus His assumption of a mortal body in order
  to drive death far from the human race belongs properly to that state
  which was laid on man by way of punishment after Adam's sin, whereas the
  fact that there was in Christ no sinful will is borrowed from that state
  which might have been if Adam had not surrendered his will to the frauds
  of the tempter. There remains, then, the third or middle state, to wit,
  that which was before death had come and while the will to sin might yet
  be present. In this state, therefore, Adam was able to eat and drink,
  digest the food he took, fall asleep, and perform all the other
  functions which always belonged to him as man, though they were allowed
  and brought with them no pain of death.</p>

<p id="id00359" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  There is no doubt that Christ was in all points thus conditioned; for He
  ate and drank and discharged the bodily function of the human body. For
  we must not think that Adam was at the first subject to such need that
  unless he ate he could not have lived, but rather that, if he had taken
  food from every tree, he could have lived for ever, and by that food
  have escaped death; and so by the fruits of the Garden he satisfied a
  need.[77] And all know that in Christ the same need dwelt, but lying in
  His own power and not laid upon Him. And this need was in Him before the
  Resurrection, but after the Resurrection He became such that His human
  body was changed as Adam's might have been but for the bands of
  disobedience. Which state, moreover, our Lord Jesus Christ Himself
  taught us to desire in our prayers, asking that His Will be done as in
  heaven so on earth, and that His Kingdom come, and that He may deliver
  us from evil. For all these things are sought in prayer by those members
  of the human family who rightly believe and who are destined to undergo
  that most blessed change of all.[78]</p>

<p id="id00360" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  So much have I written to you concerning what I believe should be
  believed. In which matter if I have said aught amiss, I am not so well
  pleased with myself as to try to press my effusions in the face of wiser
  judgment. For if there is no good thing in us there is nothing we should
  fancy in our opinions. But if all things are good as coming from Him who
  alone is good, that rather must be thought good which the Unchangeable
  Good and Cause of all Good indites.</p>

  my woful complaint in writing, methought I saw a woman stand above my
  head, having a grave countenance, glistening clear eye, and of quicker
  sight than commonly Nature doth afford; her colour fresh and bespeaking
  unabated vigour, and yet discovering so many years, that she could not
  at all be thought to belong to our times; her stature uncertain and
  doubtful, for sometime she exceeded not the common height of men, and
  sometime she seemed to touch the heavens with her head, and if she
  lifted it up to the highest, she pierced the very heavens, so that she
  could not be seen by the beholders; her garments were made of most fine
  threads with cunning workmanship into an ever-during stuff, which (as I
  knew afterward by her own report) she had woven with her own hands. A
  certain duskishness caused by negligence and time had darkened their
  colour, as it is wont to happen when pictures stand in a smoky room. In
  the lower part of them was placed the Greek letter [Greek: PI], and in
  the upper [Greek: THETA],[80] and betwixt the two letters, in the manner
  of stairs, there were certain degrees made, by which there was a passage
  from the lower to the higher letter: this her garment had been cut by
  the violence of some, who had taken away such pieces as they could get.
  In her right hand she had certain books, and in her left hand she held a
  sceptre.</p>

<p id="id00381" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  This woman, seeing the poetical Muses standing about my bed, and
  suggesting words to my tears, being moved for a little space, and
  inflamed with angry looks: "Who," saith she, "hath permitted these
  tragical harlots to have access to this sick man, which will not only
  not comfort his grief with wholesome remedies, but also nourish them
  with sugared poison? For these be they which with the fruitless thorns
  of affections do kill the fruitful crop of reason, and do accustom men's
  minds to sickness, instead of curing them. But if your flattery did
  deprive us of some profane fellow,[81] as commonly it happeneth, I
  should think that it were not so grievously to be taken, for in him our
  labours should receive no harm. But now have you laid hold of him who
  hath been brought up in Eleatical and Academical studies?[82] Rather get
  you gone, you Sirens pleasant even to destruction, and leave him to my
  Muses to be cured and healed."</p>

  upon the ground, and betraying their bashfulness with blushing, went
  sadly away. But I, whose sight was dimmed with tears, so that I could
  not discern what this woman might be, so imperious, and of such
  authority, was astonished, and, fixing my countenance upon the earth,
  began to expect with silence what she would do afterward. Then she
  coming nigher, sat down at my bed's feet, and beholding my countenance
  sad with mourning, and cast upon the ground with grief, complained of
  the perturbation of my mind with these verses.</p>

<p id="id00421">Quid igitur o magistra censes? Infitiabimur crimen, ne tibi pudor simus? At
uolui nec umquam uelle desistam. Fatebimur? Sed impediendi delatoris opera
cessauit. An optasse illius ordinis salutem nefas uocabo? Ille quidem suis
de me decretis, uti hoc nefas esset, effecerat. Sed sibi semper mentiens
inprudentia rerum merita non potest inmutare nec mihi Socratico decreto fas
esse arbitror uel occuluisse ueritatem uel concessisse mendacium. Verum id
quoquo modo sit, tuo sapientiumque iudicio aestimandum relinquo. Cuius rei
seriem atque ueritatem, ne latere posteros queat, stilo etiam memoriaeque
mandaui.</p>

<p id="id00422">Nam de compositis falso litteris quibus libertatem arguor sperasse Romanam
quid attinet dicere? Quarum fraus aperta patuisset, si nobis ipsorum
confessione delatorum, quod in omnibus negotiis maximas uires habet, uti
licuisset. Nam quae sperari reliqua libertas potest? Atque utinam posset
ulla! Respondissem Canii uerbo, qui cum a Gaio Caesare Germanici filio
conscius contra se factae coniurationis fuisse diceretur: 'Si ego,' inquit,
'scissem, tu nescisses.' Qua in re non ita sensus nostros maeror hebetauit
ut impios scelerata contra uirtutem querar molitos, sed quae sperauerint
effecisse uehementer admiror. Nam deteriora uelle nostri fuerit fortasse
defectus, posse contra innocentiam, quae sceleratus quisque conceperit
inspectante deo, monstri simile est. Vnde haud iniuria tuorum quidam
familiarium quaesiuit: 'Si quidem deus,' inquit, 'est, unde mala? Bona uero
unde, si non est?' Sed fas fuerit nefarios homines qui bonorum omnium
totiusque senatus sanguinem petunt, nos etiam quos propugnare bonis
senatuique uiderant, perditum ire uoluisse. Sed num idem de patribus quoque
merebamur? Meministi, ut opinor, quoniam me dicturum quid facturumue
praesens semper ipsa dirigebas, meministi, inquam, Veronae cum rex auidus
exitii communis maiestatis crimen in Albinum delatae ad cunctum senatus
ordinem transferre moliretur, uniuersi innocentiam senatus quanta mei
periculi securitate defenderim. Scis me haec et uera proferre et in nulla
umquam mei laude iactasse. Minuit enim quodam modo se probantis
conscientiae secretum, quotiens ostentando quis factum recipit famae
pretium. Sed innocentiam nostram quis exceperit euentus uides; pro uerae
uirtutis praemiis falsi sceleris poenas subimus. Et cuius umquam facinoris
manifesta confessio ita iudices habuit in seueritate concordes ut non
aliquos uel ipse ingenii error humani uel fortunae condicio cunctis
mortalibus incerta submitteret? Si inflammare sacras aedes uoluisse, si
sacerdotes impio iugulare gladio, si bonis omnibus necem struxisse
diceremur, praesentem tamen sententia, confessum tamen conuictumue
punisset. Nunc quingentis fere passuum milibus procul muti atque indefensi
ob studium propensius in senatum morti proscriptionique damnamur. O meritos
de simili crimine neminem posse conuinci!</p>

<p id="id00423">Cuius dignitatem reatus ipsi etiam qui detulere uiderunt, quam uti alicuius
sceleris admixtione fuscarent, ob ambitum dignitatis sacrilegio me
conscientiam polluisse mentiti sunt. Atqui et tu insita nobis omnem rerum
mortalium cupidinem de nostri animi sede pellebas et sub tuis oculis
sacrilegio locum esse fas non erat. Instillabas enim auribus
cogitationibusque cotidie meis Pythagoricum illud [Greek: hepou theoi].[87]
Nec conueniebat uilissimorum me spirituum praesidia captare quem tu in hanc
excellentiam componebas ut consimilem deo faceres. Praeterea penetral
innocens domus, honestissimorum coetus amicorum, socer etiam sanctus et
aeque ac tu ipsa[88] reuerendus ab omni nos huius criminis suspitione

hoc ipso uidebimur affines fuisse maleficio, quod tuis inbuti disciplinis,
tuis instituti moribus sumus. Ita non est satis nihil mihi tuam profuisse
reuerentiam, nisi ultro tu mea potius offensione lacereris. At uero hic
etiam nostris malis cumulus accedit, quod existimatio plurimorum non rerum
merita sed fortunae spectat euentum eaque tantum iudicat esse prouisa quae
felicitas commendauerit. Quo fit ut existimatio bona prima omnium deserat
infelices. Qui nunc populi rumores, quam dissonae multiplicesque
sententiae, piget reminisci. Hoc tantum dixerim ultimam esse aduersae
fortunae sarcinam, quod dum miseris aliquod crimen affingitur, quae
perferunt meruisse creduntur. Et ego quidem bonis omnibus pulsus,

  impression in thy mind? Art thou 'like the ass, deaf to the lyre'? Why
  weepest thou? Why sheddest thou so many tears? Speak out; hide not thy
  thoughts.[89] If thou expectest to be cured, thou must discover thy
  wound.[90]"</p>

<p id="id00430" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Then I, collecting the forces of my mind together, made her answer in
  these words: "Doth the cruelty of fortune's rage need further
  declaration, or doth it not sufficiently appear of itself? Doth not the
  very countenance of this place move thee? Is this the library which thou
  thyself hadst chosen to sit in at my house, in which thou hast
  oftentimes discoursed with me of the knowledge of divine and human
  things? Had I this attire or countenance when I searched the secrets of
  nature with thee, when thou describedst unto me the course of the stars
  with thy geometrical rod, when thou didst frame my conversation and the
  manner of my whole life according to the pattern of the celestial order?
  Are these the rewards which thy obedient servants have? But thou didst
  decree that sentence by the mouth of Plato: That commonwealths should be
  happy, if either the students of wisdom did govern them, or those which
  were appointed to govern them would give themselves to the study of
  wisdom.[91] Thou by the same philosopher didst admonish us that it is a
  sufficient cause for wise men to take upon themselves the government of
  the commonwealth, lest, if the rule of cities were left in the hands of
  lewd and wicked citizens, they should work the subversion and overthrow
  of the good.</p>

<p id="id00431" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Wherefore, following this authority, I desired to practise that by
  public administration which I had learnt of thee in private conference.
  Thou and God Himself who had inserted thee in the minds of the wise, are
  my witnesses that nothing but the common desire of all good men brought
  me to be a magistrate. This hath been the cause of my grievous and
  irreconcilable disagreements with wicked men, and that which freedom of
  conscience carrieth with it, of ever contemning the indignation of
  potentates for the defence of justice.</p>

<p id="id00432" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  How often have I encountered with Conigastus, violently possessing
  himself with poor men's goods? How often have I put back Triguilla,
  Provost of the King's house, from injuries which he had begun, yea, and
  finished also? How often have I protected, by putting my authority in
  danger, such poor wretches as the unpunished covetousness of the
  barbarous did vex with infinite reproaches? Never did any man draw me
  from right to wrong. It grieved me no less than them which suffered it,
  to see the wealth of our subjects wasted, partly by private pillage, and
  partly by public tributes.</p>

<p id="id00433" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  When in the time of a great dearth things were set at so excessive and
  unreasonable a rate that the province of Campania was like to be
  altogether impoverished, for the common good I stuck not to contend with
  the chief Praetor himself, and the matter was discussed before the King,
  and I prevailed so far that it went not forward. I drew Paulinus, who
  had been Consul, out of the very mouth of the gaping courtiers, who like
  ravenous curs had already in hope and ambition devoured his riches. That
  Albinus who had likewise been Consul might not be punished upon
  presumptuous[92] and false accusation, I exposed myself to the hatred of
  Cyprian his accuser. May I seem to have provoked enmity enough against
  myself? But others should so much the more have procured my safety,
  since that for the love I bear to justice I left myself no way by the
  means of courtiers to be safe. But by whose accusations did I receive
  this blow? By theirs who, long since having put Basil out of the King's
  service, compelled him now to accuse me, by the necessity which he was
  driven to by debt. Opilio likewise and Gaudentius being banished by the
  King's decree, for the injuries and manifold deceits which they had
  committed, because they would not obey, defended themselves by taking
  sanctuary, of which the King hearing, gave sentence, that unless they
  departed out of the city of Ravenna within certain days, they should be
  branded in the foreheads, and put out by force. What could be added to
  this severity? And yet that very day their accusations against me went
  for current. What might be the reason of this? Did my dealing deserve
  it? Or did the condemnation, which went before, make them just accusers?
  Was not fortune ashamed, if not that innocency was accused, yet at least
  that it had so vile and base accusers? But what crime was laid to my
  charge? Wilt thou have it in one word? I am said to have desired the
  Senate's safety. Wilt thou know the manner how? I am blamed for having
  hindered their accuser to bring forth evidence by which he should prove
  the Senate guilty of treason.</p>

<p id="id00434" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  What thinkest thou, O Mistress? Shall I deny this charge, that I may not
  shame thee? But it is true, I desired it, neither will I ever cease from
  having that desire. Shall I confess it? But I have already left
  hindering their accuser. Shall I call it an offence to have wished the
  safety of that order? Indeed the Senate with their decrees concerning me
  had made it an offence. But folly, always deceiving herself, cannot
  change the deserts of things, nor, according to the decree of
  Socrates,[93] do I think it is lawful either to conceal the truth or
  grant a lie. But how this may be, I leave to thine and Wisdom's censure.
  And that posterity may not be ignorant of the course and truth of the
  matter, I have put it down in writing.</p>

<p id="id00435" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  For why should I speak of those feigned letters, in which I am charged
  to have hoped for Roman liberty? The deceit of which would manifestly
  have appeared, if it might have been lawful for me to have used the
  confession of my very accusers, which in all business is of greatest
  force. For what liberty remaineth there to be hoped for? I would to God
  there were any! I would have answered as Canius did, who being charged
  by Gaius Caesar, son to Germanicus, that he was privy to the conspiracy
  made against him, answered: 'If I had been made acquainted with it, thou
  shouldest never have known of it.'[94] Neither hath sorrow so dulled my
  wits in this matter that I complain of the wicked endeavours of sinful
  men against virtue, but I exceedingly marvel to see that they have
  brought to pass the things they hoped to do. For the desire of doing
  evil may be attributed to our weakness, but that in the sight of God the
  wicked should be able to compass whatsoever they contrive against the
  innocent, is altogether monstrous. Whence not without cause one of thy
  familiar friends[95] demanded: 'If,' saith he, 'there be a God, from
  whence proceed so many evils? And if there be no God, from whence cometh
  any good?' But let that pass that wicked men, which seek the blood of
  all good men, and of the whole Senate, would also have overthrown me,
  whom they saw to stand in defence of good men and of the Senate. But did
  I deserve the same of the Senators themselves? I suppose thou
  rememberest how thou being present didst alway direct me when I went
  about to say or do anything. Thou rememberest, I say, when at Verona the
  King, being desirous of a common overthrow, endeavoured to lay the
  treason, whereof only Albinus was accused, upon the whole order of the
  Senate, with how great security of my own danger I defended the
  innocency of the whole Senate. Thou knowest that these things which I
  say are true, and that I was never delighted in my own praise, for the
  secret of a good conscience is in some sort diminished when by declaring
  what he hath done a man receiveth the reward of fame. But thou seest to
  what pass my innocency is come; instead of the rewards of true virtue, I
  undergo the punishment of wickedness, wherewith I am falsely charged.
  Was it ever yet seen that the manifest confession of any crime made the
  judges so at one in severity, that either the error of man's judgment or
  the condition of fortune, which is certain to none, did not incline some
  of them to favour? If I had been accused that I would have burnt the
  churches, or wickedly have killed the priests, or have sought the death
  of all good men, yet sentence should have been pronounced against me
  present, having confessed, and being convicted. Now being conveyed five
  hundred miles off, dumb and defenceless, I am condemned to death and
  proscription for bearing the Senate too much good will. O Senate, which
  deserves that never any may be convicted of the like crime!</p>

<p id="id00436" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  The dignity of which accusation even the very accusers themselves saw,
  which that they might obscure by adding some sort of fault, they belied
  me that I defiled my conscience with sacrilege, for an ambitious desire
  of preferment. But thou, which hadst seated thyself in me, didst repel
  from the seat of my mind all desire of mortal things, and within thy
  sight there was no place for sacrilege to harbour; for thou didst instil
  into my ears and thoughts daily that saying of Pythagoras, 'Follow
  God.'[96] Neither was it fitting for me to use the aid of most vile
  spirits when thou wast shaping me into that excellency to make me like
  to God. Besides the innocency which appeared in the most retired rooms
  of my house, the assembly of my most honourable friends, my holy father-
  in-law Symmachus, who is as worthy of reverence as thou thyself art, do
  clear me from all suspicion of this crime. But O detestable wickedness!
  they the rather credit thee with so great a crime, and think me the
  nigher to such mischievous dealing, because I am endued with thy
  knowledge, and adorned with thy virtues, so that it is not enough that I
  reap no commodity for thy respect, unless thou beest also dishonoured
  for the hatred conceived against me. And that my miseries may increase
  the more, the greatest part do not so much respect the value of things
  as the event of fortune, and they esteem only that to be providently
  done which the happy success commends. By which means it cometh to pass
  that the first loss which miserable men have is their estimation and the
  good opinion which was had of them. What rumours go now among the
  people, what dissonant and diverse opinions! I cannot abide to think of
  them; only this will I say, the last burden of adversity is that when
  they which are in misery are accused of any crime, they are thought to
  deserve whatsoever they suffer. And I, spoiled of all my goods, bereaved
  of my dignities, blemished in my good name, for benefits receive
  punishments.</p>

<p id="id00437" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  And methinks I see the cursed crews of the wicked abounding with joy and
  gladness, and every lost companion devising with himself how to accuse
  others falsely, good men lie prostrate with the terror of my danger, and
  every lewd fellow is provoked by impunity to attempt any wickedness, and
  by rewards to bring it to effect; but the innocent are not only deprived
  of all security, but also of any manner of defence. Wherefore I may well
  exclaim:</p>
