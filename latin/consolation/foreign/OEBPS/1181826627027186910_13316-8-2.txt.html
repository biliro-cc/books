<p id="id00254">Anxie te quidem diuque sustinui, ut de ea quae in conuentu mota est
quaestione loqueremur. Sed quoniam et tu quominus uenires occupatione
distractus es et ego in crastinum constitutis negotiis implicabor, mando
litteris quae coram loquenda seruaueram. Meministi enim, cum in concilio
legeretur epistola, recitatum Eutychianos ex duabus naturis Christum
consistere confiteri, in duabus negare: catholicos uero utrique dicto fidem
praebere, nam et ex duabus eum naturis consistere et in duabus apud uerae
fidei sectatores aequaliter credi. Cuius dicti nouitate percussus harum
coniunctionum quae ex duabus naturis uel in duabus consisterent
differentias inquirebam, multum scilicet referre ratus nec inerti
neglegentia praetereundum, quod episcopus scriptor epistolae tamquam ualde
necessarium praeterire noluisset. Hic omnes apertam esse differentiam nec
quicquam in eo esse caliginis inconditum confusumque strepere nec ullus in
tanto tumultu qui leuiter attingeret quaestionem, nedum qui expediret
inuentus est.</p>

<p id="id00255">Adsederam ego ab eo quem maxime intueri cupiebam longius atque adeo, si
situm sedentium recorderis, auersus pluribusque oppositis, ne si aegerrime
quidem cuperem, uultum nutumque eius aspicere poteram ex quo mihi aliqua
eius darentur signa iudicii. Atqui ego quidem nihil ceteris amplius
afferebam, immo uero aliquid etiam minus. Nam de re proposita aeque nihil
ceteris sentiebam; minus uero quam ceteri ipse afferebam, falsae scilicet
scientiae praesumptionem. Tuli aegerrime, fateor, compressusque indoctorum
grege conticui metuens ne iure uiderer insanus, si sanus inter furiosos
haberi contenderem. Meditabar igitur dehinc omnes animo quaestiones nec
deglutiebam quod acceperam, sed frequentis consilii iteratione ruminabam.
Tandem igitur patuere pulsanti animo fores et ueritas inuenta quaerenti
omnes nebulas Eutychiani reclusit erroris. Vnde mihi maxime subiit
admirari, quaenam haec indoctorum hominum esset audacia qui inscientiae
uitium praesumptionis atque inpudentiae nube conentur obducere, cum non
modo saepe id quod proponatur ignorent, uerum in huiusmodi contentionibus
ne id quidem quod ipsi loquantur intellegant, quasi non deterior fiat
inscientiae causa, dum tegitur.</p>

<h5 id="id00258">  BY ANICIUS MANLIUS SEVERINUS BOETHIUS MOST HONOURABLE, OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS
  ORDER OF EX-CONSULS, PATRICIAN</h5>

<h5 id="id00259">  TO HIS SAINTLY MASTER AND REVEREND FATHER JOHN THE DEACON
  HIS SON BOETHIUS</h5>

<p id="id00260" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I have been long and anxiously waiting for you to discuss with me the
  problem which was raised at the meeting. But since your duties have
  prevented your coming and I shall be for some time involved in my
  business engagements, I am setting down in writing what I had been
  keeping to say by word of mouth.</p>

<p id="id00261" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  You no doubt remember how, when the letter[53] was read in the assembly,
  it was asserted that the Eutychians confess that Christ is formed from
  two natures but does not consist of themâ€”whereas Catholics admit both
  propositions, for among followers of the true Faith He is equally
  believed to be of two natures and in two natures. Struck by the novelty
  of this assertion I began to inquire what difference there can be
  between unions formed from two natures and unions which consist in two
  natures, for the point which the bishop who wrote the letter refused to
  pass over because of its gravity, seemed to me of importance and not one
  to be idly and carelessly slurred over. On that occasion all loudly
  protested that the difference was evident, that there was no obscurity,
  confusion or perplexity, and in the general storm and tumult there was
  no one who really touched the edge of the problem, much less anyone who
  solved it.</p>

<p id="id00262" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I was sitting a long way from the man whom I especially wished to
  watch,[54] and if you recall the arrangement of the seats, I was turned
  away from him, with so many between us, that however much I desired it I
  could not see his face and expression and glean therefrom any sign of
  his opinion. Personally, indeed, I had nothing more to contribute than
  the rest, in fact rather less than more. I, no more than the others, had
  any view about the question at issue, while my possible contribution was
  less by one thing, namely, the false assumption of a knowledge that I
  had not got. I was, I admit, much put out, and being overwhelmed by the
  mob of ignorant speakers, I held my peace, fearing lest I should be
  rightly set down as insane if I held out for being sane among those
  madmen.[55] So I continued to ponder all the questions in my mind, not
  swallowing what I had heard, but rather chewing the cud of constant
  meditation. At last the door opened to my insistent knocking, and the
  truth which I found cleared out of my way all the clouds of the
  Eutychian error. And with this discovery a great wonder came upon me at
  the vast temerity of unlearned men who use the cloak of impudent
  presumption to cover up the vice of ignorance, for not only do they
  often fail to grasp the point at issue, but in a debate of this kind
  they do not even understand their own statements, forgetting that the
  case of ignorance is all the worse if it is not honestly admitted.[56]</p>

<p id="id00263" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I turn from them to you, and to you I submit this little essay for your
  first judgment and consideration. If you pronounce it to be sound I beg
  you to place it among the other writings of mine which you possess; but
  if there is anything to be struck out or added or changed in any way, I
  would ask you to let me have your suggestions, in order that I may enter
  them in my copies just as they leave your hands. When this revision has
  been duly accomplished, then I will send the work on to be judged by the
  man to whom I always submit everything.[57] But since the pen is now to
  take the place of the living voice, let me first clear away the extreme
  and self-contradictory errors of Nestorius and Eutyches; after that, by
  God's help, I will temperately set forth the middle way of the Christian
  Faith. But since in this whole question of self-contradictory heresies
  the matter of debate is Persons and Natures, these terms must first be
  defined and distinguished by their proper differences.</p>

<p id="id00264" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  [53] Evidently the letter addressed to Pope Symmachus by the Oriental
  bishops (<i>vide</i> Mansi, <i>Concil</i>. viii. 221 ff.), in which they inquire
  concerning the safe middle way between the heresies of Eutyches and
  Nestorius. The date of the bishops' letter, and consequently, in all
  probability, of Boethius's tractate was 512.</p>

<p id="id00270">Natura igitur aut de solis corporibus dici potest aut de solis substantiis,
id est corporeis atque incorporeis, aut de omnibus rebus quae quocumque
modo esse dicuntur. Cum igitur tribus modis natura dici possit, tribus
modis sine dubio definienda est. Nam si de omnibus rebus naturam dici
placet, talis definitio dabitur quae res omnes quae sunt possit includere.
Erit ergo huiusmodi: "natura est earum rerum quae, cum sint, quoquo modo
intellectu capi possunt." In hac igitur definitione et accidentia et
substantiae definiuntur; haec enim omnia intellectu capi possunt. Additum
uero est "quoquo modo," quoniam deus et materia integro perfectoque
intellectu intellegi non possunt, sed aliquo tamen modo ceterarum rerum
priuatione capiuntur. Idcirco uero adiunximus "quae cum sint," quoniam
etiam ipsum nihil significat aliquid sed non naturam. Neque enim quod sit
aliquid sed potius non esse significat; omnis uero natura est. Et si de
omnibus quidem rebus naturam dici placet, haec sit naturae definitio quam
superius proposuimus. Sin uero de solis substantiis natura dicitur, quoniam
substantiae omnes aut corporeae sunt aut incorporeae, dabimus definitionem
naturae substantias significanti huiusmodi: "natura est uel quod facere uel
quod pati possit." "Pati" quidem ac "facere," ut omnia corporea atque
corporeorum anima; haec enim in corpore et a corpore et facit et patitur.
"Facere" uero tantum ut deus ceteraque diuina. Habes igitur definitionem
eius quoque significationis naturae quae tantum substantiis applicatur. Qua
in re substantiae quoque est reddita definitio. Nam si nomen naturae
substantiam monstrat, cum naturam descripsimus substantiae quoque est
assignata descriptio. Quod si naturae nomen relictis incorporeis
substantiis ad corporales usque contrahitur, ut corporeae tantum
substantiae naturam habere uideantur, sicut Aristoteles ceterique et
eiusmodi et multimodae philosophiae sectatores putant, definiemus eam, ut
hi etiam qui naturam non nisi in corporibus esse posuerunt. Est autem eius
definitio hoc modo: "natura est motus principium per se non per accidens."
Quod "motus principium" dixi hoc est, quoniam corpus omne habet proprium
motum, ut ignis sursum, terra deorsum. Item quod "per se principium motus"
naturam esse proposui et non "per accidens," tale est, quoniam lectum
quoque ligneum deorsum ferri necesse est, sed non deorsum per accidens
fertur. Idcirco enim quia lignum est, quod est terra, pondere et grauitate
deducitur. Non enim quia lectus est, deorsum cadit, sed quia terra est, id
est quia terrae contigit, ut lectus esset; unde fit ut lignum naturaliter
esse dicamus, lectum uero artificialiter. Est etiam alia significatio
naturae per quam dicimus diuersam esse naturam auri atque argenti in hoc
proprietatem rerum monstrare cupientes, quae significatio naturae
definietur hoc modo: "natura est unam quamque rem informans specifica
differentia." Cum igitur tot modis uel dicatur uel definiatur natura, tam
catholici quam Nestorius secundum ultimam definitionem duas in Christo
naturas esse constituunt; neque enim easdem in deum atque hominem
differentias conuenire.</p>

<h2 id="id00271" style="margin-top: 4em">  I.</h2>

<p id="id00272" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Nature, then, may be affirmed either of bodies alone or of substances
  alone, that is, of corporeals or incorporeals, or of everything that is
  in any way capable of affirmation. Since, then, nature can be affirmed
  in three ways, it must obviously be defined in three ways. For if you
  choose to affirm nature of the totality of things, the definition will
  be of such a kind as to include all things that are. It will accordingly
  be something of this kind: "Nature belongs to those things which, since
  they exist, can in some measure be apprehended by the mind." This
  definition, then, includes both accidents and substances, for they all
  can be apprehended by the mind. But I add "in some measure" because God
  and matter cannot be apprehended by mind, be it never so whole and
  perfect, but still they are apprehended in a measure through the removal
  of accidents. The reason for adding the words, "since they exist," is
  that the mere word "nothing" denotes something, though it does not
  denote nature. For it denotes, indeed, not that anything is, but rather
  non-existence; but every nature exists. And if we choose to affirm
  "nature" of the totality of things, the definition will be as we have
  given it above.</p>

<p id="id00273" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But if "nature" is affirmed of substances alone, we shall, since all
  substances are either corporeal or incorporeal, give to nature denoting
  substances a definition of the following kind: "Nature is either that
  which can act or that which can be acted upon." Now the power to act and
  to suffer belongs to all corporeals and the soul of corporeals; for it
  both acts in the body and suffers by the body. But only to act belongs
  to God and other divine substances.</p>

<p id="id00274" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Here, then, you have a further definition of what nature is as applied
  to substances alone. This definition comprises also the definition of
  substance. For if the word nature signifies substance, when once we have
  defined nature we have also settled the definition of substance. But if
  we neglect incorporeal substances and confine the name nature to
  corporeal substances so that they alone appear to possess the nature of
  substanceâ€”which is the view of Aristotle and the adherents both of his
  and various other schoolsâ€”we shall define nature as those do who have
  only allowed the word to be applied to bodies. Now, in accordance with
  this view, the definition is as follows: "Nature is the principle of
  movement properly inherent in and not accidentally attached to bodies."
  I say "principle of movement" because every body has its proper
  movement, fire moving upwards, the earth moving downwards. And what I
  mean by "movement properly inherent and not accidentally attached" is
  seen by the example of a wooden bed which is necessarily borne downward
  and is not carried downward by accident. For it is drawn downward by
  weight and heaviness because it is of wood, i.e. an earthly material.
  For it falls down not because it is a bed, but because it is earth, that
  is, because it is an accident of earth that it is a bed; hence we call
  it wood in virtue of its nature, but bed in virtue of the art that
  shaped it.</p>

<p id="id00275" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Nature has, further, another meaning according to which we speak of the
  different nature of gold and silver, wishing thereby to point the
  special property of things; this meaning of nature will be defined as
  follows: "Nature is the specific difference that gives form to
  anything." Thus, although nature is described or defined in all these
  different ways, both Catholics and Nestorians firmly hold that there are
  in Christ two natures of the kind laid down in our last definition, for
  the same specific differences cannot apply to God and man.</p>

<h2 id="id00276" style="margin-top: 4em">II.</h2>

<p id="id00277">Sed de persona maxime dubitari potest, quaenam ei definitio possit aptari.
Si enim omnis habet natura personam, indissolubilis nodus est, quaenam
inter naturam personamque possit esse discretio; aut si non aequatur
persona naturae, sed infra terminum spatiumque naturae persona subsistit,
difficile dictu est ad quas usque naturas persona perueniat, id est quas
naturas conueniat habere personam, quas a personae uocabulo segregari. Nam
illud quidem manifestum est personae subiectam esse naturam nec praeter
naturam personam posse praedicari. Vestiganda sunt igitur haec
inquirentibus hoc modo.</p>

<p id="id00278">Quoniam praeter naturam non potest esse persona quoniamque naturae aliae
sunt substantiae, aliae accidentes et uidemus personam in accidentibus non
posse constitui (quis enim dicat ullam albedinis uel nigredinis uel
magnitudinis esse personam?), relinquitur ergo ut personam in substantiis
dici conueniat. Sed substantiarum aliae sunt corporeae, aliae incorporeae.
Corporearum uero aliae sunt uiuentes, aliae minime; uiuentium aliae sunt
sensibiles, aliae minime; sensibilium aliae rationales, aliae inrationales.
Item incorporearum aliae sunt rationales, aliae minime, ut pecudum uitae;
rationalium uero alia est inmutabilis atque inpassibilis per naturam ut
deus, alia per creationem mutabilis atque passibilis, nisi inpassibilis
gratia substantiae ad inpassibilitatis firmitudinem permutetur ut angelorum
atque animae. Ex quibus omnibus neque in non uiuentibus corporibus personam
posse dici manifestum est (nullus enim lapidis ullam dicit esse personam),
neque rursus eorum uiuentium quae sensu carent (neque enim ulla persona est
arboris), nec uero eius quae intellectu ac ratione deseritur (nulla est
enim persona equi uel bouis ceterorumque animalium quae muta ac sine
ratione uitam solis sensibus degunt), at hominis dicimus esse personam,
dicimus dei, dicimus angeli. Rursus substantiarum aliae sunt uniuersales,
aliae particulares. Vniuersales sunt quae de singulis praedicantur ut homo,
animal, lapis, lignum ceteraque huiusmodi quae uel genera uel species sunt;
nam et homo de singulis hominibus et animal de singulis animalibus lapisque
ac lignum de singulis lapidibus ac lignis dicuntur. Particularia uero sunt
quae de aliis minime praedicantur ut Cicero, Plato, lapis hic unde haec
Achillis statua facta est, lignum hoc unde haec mensa composita est. Sed in
his omnibus nusquam in uniuersalibus persona dici potest, sed in
singularibus tantum atque in indiuiduis; animalis enim uel generalis
hominis nulla persona est, sed uel Ciceronis uel Platonis uel singulorum
indiuiduorum personae singulae nuncupantur.</p>

<h2 id="id00279" style="margin-top: 4em">  II.</h2>

<p id="id00280" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But the proper definition of Person is a matter of very great
  perplexity. For if every nature has person, the difference between
  nature and person is a hard knot to unravel; or if person is not taken
  as the equivalent of nature but is a term of less scope and range, it is
  difficult to say to what natures it may be extended, that is, to what
  natures the term person may be applied and what natures are dissociate
  from it. For one thing is clear, namely that nature is a substrate of
  Person, and that Person cannot be predicated apart from nature.</p>

<p id="id00281">  We must, therefore, conduct our inquiry into these points as follows.</p>

<p id="id00282" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Since Person cannot exist apart from a nature and since natures are
  either substances or accidents and we see that a person cannot come into
  being among accidents (for who can say there is any person of white or
  black or size?), it therefore remains that Person is properly applied to
  substances. But of substances, some are corporeal and others
  incorporeal. And of corporeals, some are living and others the reverse;
  of living substances, some are sensitive and others insensitive; of
  sensitive substances, some are rational and others irrational.[58]
  Similarly of incorporeal substances, some are rational, others the
  reverse (for instance the animating spirits of beasts); but of rational
  substances there is one which is immutable and impassible by nature,
  namely God, another which in virtue of its creation is mutable and
  passible except in that case where the Grace of the impassible substance
  has transformed it to the unshaken impassibility which belongs to angels
  and to the soul.</p>

<p id="id00283" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Now from all the definitions we have given it is clear that Person
  cannot be affirmed of bodies which have no life (for no one ever said
  that a stone had a person), nor yet of living things which lack sense
  (for neither is there any person of a tree), nor finally of that which
  is bereft of mind and reason (for there is no person of a horse or ox or
  any other of the animals which dumb and unreasoning live a life of sense
  alone), but we say there is a person of a man, of God, of an angel.
  Again, some substances are universal, others are particular. Universal
  terms are those which are predicated of individuals, as man, animal,
  stone, stock and other things of this kind which are either genera or
  species; for the term man is applied to individual men just as animal is
  to individual animals, and stone and stock to individual stones and
  stocks. But particulars are terms which are never predicated of other
  things, as Cicero, Plato, this stone from which this statue of Achilles
  was hewn, this piece of wood out of which this table was made. But in
  all these things person cannot in any case be applied to universals, but
  only to particulars and individuals; for there is no person of a man if
  animal or general; only the single persons of Cicero, Plato, or other
  single individuals are termed persons.</p>

<p id="id00284" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  [58] For a similar example of the method of <i>diuisio</i> cf. Cic. <i>De Off.</i>
  ii. 3. 11. Cf. also <i>Isag. Porph. edit. prima</i>, i. 10 (ed. Brandt, p.
  29).</p>

<h2 id="id00285" style="margin-top: 4em">III.</h2>

<p id="id00286">Quocirca si persona in solis substantiis est atque in his rationabilibus
substantiaque omnis natura est nec in uniuersalibus sed in indiuiduis
constat, reperta personae est definitio: "naturae rationabilis indiuidua
substantia." Sed nos hac definitione eam quam Graeci [Greek: hupostasin]
dicunt terminauimus. Nomen enim personae uidetur aliunde traductum, ex his
scilicet personis quae in comoediis tragoediisque eos quorum interest
homines repraesentabant. Persona uero dicta est a personando circumflexa
paenultima. Quod si acuatur antepaenultima, apertissime a sono dicta
uidebitur; idcirco autem a sono, quia concauitate ipsa maior necesse est
uoluatur sonus. Graeci quoque has personas [Greek: prosopa] uocant ab eo
quod ponantur in facie atque ante oculos obtegant uultum: [Greek: para tou
pros tous opas tithesthai.] Sed quoniam personis inductis histriones
indiuiduos homines quorum intererat in tragoedia uel in comoedia ut dictum
est repraesentabant, id est Hecubam uel Medeam uel Simonem uel Chremetem,
idcirco ceteros quoque homines, quorum certa pro sui forma esset agnitio,
et Latini personam et Graeci [Greek: prosopa] nuncupauerunt. Longe uero
illi signatius naturae rationabilis indiuiduam subsistentiam [Greek:
hupostaseos] nomine uocauerunt, nos uero per inopiam significantium uocum
translaticiam retinuimus nuncupationem, eam quam illi [Greek: hupostasin]
dicunt personam uocantes; sed peritior Graecia sermonum [Greek: hupostasin]
uocat indiuiduam subsistentiam. Atque, uti Graeca utar oratione in rebus
quae a Graecis agitata Latina interpretatione translata sunt: [Greek: hai
ousiai en men tois katholou einai dunantai. en de tois atomois kai kata
meros monois huphistantai], id est: essentiae in uniuersalibus quidem esse
possunt, in solis uero indiuiduis et particularibus substant. Intellectus
enim uniuersalium rerum ex particularibus sumptus est. Quocirca cum ipsae
subsistentiae in uniuersalibus quidem sint, in particularibus uero capiant
substantiam, iure subsistentias particulariter substantes [Greek:
hupostaseis] appellauerunt. Neque enim pensius subtiliusque intuenti idem
uidebitur esse subsistentia quod substantia.</p>

<p id="id00287">Nam quod Graeci [Greek: ousiosin] uel [Greek: ousiosthai] dicunt, id nos
subsistentiam uel subsistere appellamus; quod uero illi [Greek: hupostasin]
uel [Greek: huphistasthai], id nos substantiam uel substare interpretamur.
Subsistit enim quod ipsum accidentibus, ut possit esse, non indiget.
Substat autem id quod aliis accidentibus subiectum quoddam, ut esse
ualeant, subministrat; sub illis enim stat, dum subiectum est accidentibus.
Itaque genera uel species subsistunt tantum; neque enim accidentia
generibus speciebus*ue contingunt. Indiuidua uero non modo subsistunt uerum
etiam substant, nam neque ipsa indigent accidentibus ut sint; informata
enim sunt iam propriis et specificis differentiis et accidentibus ut esse
possint ministrant, dum sunt scilicet subiecta. Quocirca [Greek: einai]
atque [Greek: ousiosthai] esse atque subsistere, [Greek: huphistasthai]
uero substare intellegitur. Neque enim uerborum inops Graecia est, ut
Marcus Tullius alludit, sed essentiam, subsistentiam, substantiam, personam
totidem nominibus reddit, essentiam quidem [Greek: ousian], subsistentiam
uero [Greek: ousiosin], substantiam [Greek: hupostasin], personam [Greek:
prosopon] appellans. Ideo autem [Greek: hupostaseis] Graeci indiuiduas
substantias uocauerunt, quoniam ceteris subsunt et quibusdam quasi
accidentibus subpositae subiectaeque sunt; atque idcirco nos quoque eas
substantias nuncupamus quasi subpositas, quas illi[59] [Greek:
hupostaseis], cumque etiam [Greek: prosopa] nuncupent easdem substantias,
possumus nos quoque nuncupare personas. Idem est igitur [Greek: ousian]
esse quod essentiam, idem [Greek: ousiosin] quod subsistentiam, idem
[Greek: hupostasin] quod substantiam, idem [Greek: prosopon] quod personam.
Quare autem de inrationabilibus animalibus Graecus [Greek: hupostasin] non
dicat, sicut nos de eisdem nomen substantiae praedicamus, haec ratio est,
quoniam nomen hoc melioribus applicatum est, ut aliqua id quod est
excellentius, tametsi non descriptione naturae secundum id quod [Greek:
huphistasthai] atque substare est, at certe [Greek: hupostaseos] uel
substantiae uocabulis discerneretur.</p>

<p id="id00288">Est igitur et hominis quidem essentia, id est [Greek: ousia], et
subsistentia, id est [Greek: ousiosis], et [Greek: hupostasis], id est
substantia, et [Greek: prosopon], id est persona; [Greek: ousia], quidem
atque essentia quoniam est, [Greek: ousiosis] uero atque subsistentia
quoniam in nullo subiecto est, [Greek: hupostasis] uero atque substantia,

<p id="id00291" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Wherefore if Person belongs to substances alone, and these rational, and
  if every nature is a substance, existing not in universals but in
  individuals, we have found the definition of Person, viz.: "The
  individual substance of a rational nature."[60] Now by this definition
  we Latins have described what the Greeks call [Greek: hupostasis]. For
  the word person seems to be borrowed from a different source, namely
  from the masks which in comedies and tragedies used to signify the
  different subjects of representation. Now <i>persona</i> "mask" is
  derived from <i>personare</i>, with a circumflex on the penultimate. But
  if the accent is put on the antepenultimate[61] the word will clearly be
  seen to come from <i>sonus</i> "sound," and for this reason, that the
  hollow mask necessarily produces a larger sound. The Greeks, too, call
  these masks [Greek: prosopa] from the fact that they are placed over the
  face and conceal the countenance from the spectator: [Greek: para tou
  pros tous opas tithesthai]. But since, as we have said, it was by the
  masks they put on that actors played the different characters
  represented in a tragedy or comedyâ€”Hecuba or Medea or Simon or
  Chremes,â€”so also all other men who could be recognized by their several
  characteristics were designated by the Latins with the term
  <i>persona</i> and by the Greeks with [Greek: prosopa]. But the Greeks
  far more clearly gave to the individual subsistence of a rational nature
  the name [Greek: hupostasis] while we through want of appropriate words
  have kept a borrowed term, calling that <i>persona</i> which they call
  [Greek: hupostasis]; but Greece with its richer vocabulary gives the
  name [Greek: hupostasis] to the individual subsistence. And, if I may
  use Greek in dealing with matters which were first mooted by Greeks
  before they came to be interpreted in Latin: [Greek: hai ousiai en men
  tois katholou einai dunantai. en de tois atomois kai kata meros monois
  huphistantai], that is: essences indeed can have potential existence in
  universals, but they have particular substantial existence in
  particulars alone. For it is from particulars that all our comprehension
  of universals is taken. Wherefore since subsistences are present in
  universals but acquire substance in particulars they rightly gave the
  name [Greek: hupostasis] to subsistences which acquired substance
  through the medium of particulars. For to no one using his eyes with any
  care or penetration will subsistence and substance appear identical.</p>

<p id="id00292" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  For our equivalents of the Greek terms [Greek: ousiosis ousiosthai] are
  respectively <i>subsistentia</i> and <i>subsistere</i>, while their
  [Greek: hupostasis huphistasthai] are represented by our
  <i>substantia</i> and <i>substare</i>. For a thing has subsistence when
  it does not require accidents in order to be, but that thing has
  substance which supplies to other things, accidents to wit, a substrate
  enabling them to be; for it "substands" those things so long as it is
  subjected to accidents. Thus genera and species have only subsistence,
  for accidents do not attach to genera and species. But particulars have
  not only subsistence but substance, for they, no more than generals,
  depend on accidents for their Being; for they are already provided with
  their proper and specific differences and they enable accidents to be by
  supplying them with a substrate. Wherefore <i>esse</i> and
  <i>subsistere</i> represent [Greek: einai] and [Greek: ousiosthai],
  while <i>substare</i> represents [Greek: huphistasthai]. For Greece is
  not, as Marcus Tullius[62] playfully says, short of words, but provides
  exact equivalents for <i>essentia, subsistentia, substantia</i> and
  <i>persona</i>â€”[Greek: ousia] for <i>essentia</i>, [Greek: ousiosis]
  for <i>subsistentia</i>, [Greek: hupostasis] for <i>substantia</i>,
  [Greek: prosopon] for <i>persona</i>. But the Greeks called individual
  substances [Greek: hupostaseis] because they underlie the rest and offer
  support and substrate to what are called accidents; and we in our term
  call them substances as being substrateâ€”[Greek: hupostaseis], and since
  they also term the same substances [Greek: prosopa], we too may call
  them persons. So [Greek: ousia] is identical with essence, [Greek:
  ousiosis] with subsistence, [Greek: hupostasis] with substance, [Greek:
  prosopon] with person. But the reason why the Greek does not use [Greek:
  hupostasis] of irrational animals while we apply the term substance to
  them is this: This term was applied to things of higher value, in order
  that what is more excellent might be distinguished, if not by a
  definition of nature answering to the literal meaning of [Greek:
  huphistasthai]=<i>substare</i>, at any rate by the words [Greek:
  hupostasis]=<i>substantia</i>.</p>

<p id="id00293" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  To begin with, then, man is essence, i.e. [Greek: ousia], subsistence,
  i.e. [Greek: ousiosis, hupostasis], i.e. substance, [Greek: prosopon],
  i.e. person: [Greek: ousia] or <i>essentia</i> because he is, [Greek:
  ousiosis], or subsistence because he is not accidental to any subject,
  [Greek: hupostusis] or substance because he is subject to all the things
  which are not subsistences or [Greek: ousioseis], while he is [Greek:
  prosopon] or person because he is a rational individual. Next, God is
  [Greek: ousia], or essence, for He is and is especially that from which
  proceeds the Being of all things. To Him belong [Greek: ousiosis], i.e.
  subsistence, for He subsists in absolute independence, and [Greek:
  huphistasthai], for He is substantial Being. Whence we go on to say that
  there is one [Greek: ousia] or [Greek: ousiosis], i.e. one essence or
  subsistence of the Godhead, but three [Greek: hupostaseis] or
  substances. And indeed, following this use, men have spoken of One
  essence, three substances and three persons of the Godhead. For did not
  the language of the Church forbid us to say three substances in speaking
  of God,[63] substance might seem a right term to apply to Him, not
  because He underlies all other things like a substrate, but because,
  just as He excels above all things, so He is the foundation and support
  of things, supplying them all with [Greek: ousiosthai] or subsistence.</p>

quoniam in Christo duplicem naturam esse censebat, duplicem quoque personam

non est Christi una persona duasque naturas esse manifestum est, hominis
scilicet atque dei (nec tam erit insipiens quisquam, utqui utramque earum a
ratione seiungat), sequitur ut duae uideantur esse personae; est enim
persona ut dictum est naturae rationabilis indiuidua substantia.</p>

<p id="id00300">Quae est igitur facta hominis deique coniunctio? Num ita quasi cum duo
corpora sibimet apponuntur, ut tantum locis iuncta sint et nihil in alterum
ex alterius qualitate perueniat? Quem coniunctionis Graeci modum [Greek:
kata parathesin] uocant. Sed si ita humanitas diuinitati coniuncta est,
nihil horum ex utrisque confectum est ac per hoc nihil est Christus. Nomen
quippe ipsum unum quiddam significat singularitate uocabuli. At si duabus
personis manentibus ea coniunctio qualem superius diximus facta est
naturarum, unum ex duobus effici nihil potuit; omnino enim ex duabus
personis nihil umquam fieri potest. Nihil igitur unum secundum Nestorium
Christus est ac per hoc omnino nihil. Quod enim non est unum, nec esse
omnino potest; esse enim atque unum conuertitur et quodcumque unum est est.
Etiam ea quae ex pluribus coniunguntur ut aceruus, chorus, unum tamen sunt.
Sed esse Christum manifeste ac ueraciter confitemur; unum igitur esse
dicimus Christum. Quod si ita est, unam quoque Christi sine dubitatione
personam esse necesse est. Nam si duae personae essent, unus esse non
posset; duos uero esse dicere Christos nihil est aliud nisi praecipitatae
mentis insania. Cur enim omnino duos audeat Christos uocare, unum hominem
alium deum? Vel cur eum qui deus est Christum uocat, si eum quoque qui homo
est Christum est appellaturus, cum nihil simile, nihil habeant ex
copulatione coniunctum? Cur simili nomine diuersissimis abutatur naturis,
cum, si Christum definire cogitur, utrisque ut ipse dicit Christis non
possit unam definitionis adhibere substantiam? Si enim dei atque hominis
diuersa substantia est unumque in utrisque Christi nomen nec diuersarum
coniunctio substantiarum unam creditur fecisse personam, aequiuocum nomen
est Christi et nulla potest definitione concludi. Quibus autem umquam
scripturis nomen Christi geminatur? Quid uero noui per aduentum saluatoris
effectum est? Nam catholicis et fidei ueritas et raritas miraculi constat.
Quam enim magnum est quamque nouum, quam quod semel nec ullo alio saeculo
possit euenire, ut eius qui solus est deus natura cum humana quae ab eo
erat diuersissima conueniret atque ita ex distantibus naturis una fieret
copulatione persona! Secundum Nestorii uero sententiam quid contingit noui?
"Seruant," inquit, "proprias humanitas diuinitasque personas." Quando enim
non fuit diuinitatis propria humanitatisque persona? Quando uero non erit?
Vel quid amplius in Iesu generatione contingit quam in cuiuslibet alterius,
si discretis utrisque personis discretae etiam fuere naturae? Ita enim
personis manentibus illic nulla naturarum potuit esse coniunctio, ut in
quolibet homine, cuius cum propria persona subsistat, nulla est ei
excellentissimae substantiae coniuncta diuinitas. Sed fortasse Iesum, id
est personam hominis, idcirco Christum uocet, quoniam per eam mira quaedam
sit operata diuinitas. Esto. Deum uero ipsum Christi appellatione cur
uocet? Cur uero non elementa quoque ipsa simili audeat appellare uocabulo
per quae deus mira quaedam cotidianis motibus operatur? An quia
inrationabiles substantiae non possunt habere personam qua[64] Christi
uocabulum excipere possint[65]? Nonne in sanctis hominibus ac pietate
conspicuis apertus diuinitatis actus agnoscitur? Nihil enim intererit, cur
non sanctos quoque uiros eadem appellatione dignetur, si in adsumptione
humanitatis non est una ex coniunctione persona. Sed dicat forsitan, "Illos
quoque Christos uocari fateor, sed ad imaginem ueri Christi." Quod si nulla
ex homine atque deo una persona coniuncta est, omnes ita ueros Christos
arbitrabimur ut hunc qui ex uirgine genitus creditur. Nulla quippe in hoc
adunata persona est ex dei atque hominis copulatione sicut nec in eis, qui
dei spiritu de uenturo Christo praedicebant, propter quod etiam ipsi quoque
appellati sunt Christi. Iam uero sequitur, ut personis manentibus nullo
modo a diuinitate humanitas credatur adsumpta. Omnino enim disiuncta sunt
quae aeque personis naturisque separantur, prorsus inquam disiuncta sunt
nec magis inter se homines bouesque disiuncti quam diuinitas in Christo
humanitasque discreta est, si mansere personae. Homines quippe ac boues una
animalis communitate iunguntur; est enim illis secundum genus communis
substantia eademque in uniuersalitatis collectione natura. Deo uero atque
homini quid non erit diuersa ratione disiunctum, si sub diuersitate naturae
personarum quoque credatur mansisse discretio? Non est igitur saluatum
genus humanum, nulla in nos salus Christi generatione processit, tot
prophetarum scripturae populum inlusere credentem, omnis ueteris testamenti
spernatur auctoritas per quam salus mundo Christi generatione promittitur.
Non autem prouenisse manifestum est, si eadem in persona est quae in natura
diuersitas. Eundem quippe saluum fecit quem creditur adsumpsisse; nulla
uero intellegi adsumptio potest, si manet aeque naturae personaeque

<p id="id00305" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  You must consider that all I have said so far has been for the purpose
  of marking the difference between Nature and Person, that is, [Greek:
  ousia] and [Greek: hupostasis]. The exact terms which should be applied
  in each case must be left to the decision of ecclesiastical usage. For
  the time being let that distinction between Nature and Person hold which
  I have affirmed, viz. that Nature is the specific property of any
  substance, and Person the individual substance of a rational nature.
  Nestorius affirmed that in Christ Person was twofold, being led astray
  by the false notion that Person may be applied to every nature. For on
  this assumption, understanding that there were in Christ two natures, he
  declared that there were likewise two persons. And although the
  definition which we have already given is enough to prove Nestorius
  wrong, his error shall be further declared by the following argument. If
  the Person of Christ is not single, and if it is clear that there are in
  Him two natures, to wit, divine and human (and no one will be so foolish
  as to fail to include either in the definition), it follows that there
  must apparently be two persons; for Person, as has been said, is the
  individual substance of a rational nature.</p>

<p id="id00306" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  What kind of union, then, between God and man has been effected? Is it
  as when two bodies are laid the one against the other, so that they are
  only joined locally, and no touch of the quality of the one reaches the
  otherâ€”the kind of union which the Greeks term [Greek: kata parathesin]
  "by juxtaposition"? But if humanity has been united to divinity in this
  way no one thing has been formed out of the two, and hence Christ is
  nothing. The very name of Christ, indeed, denotes by its singular number
  a unity. But if the two persons continued and such a union of natures as
  we have above described took place, there could be no unity formed from
  two things, for nothing could ever possibly be formed out of two
  persons. Therefore Christ is, according to Nestorius, in no respect one,
  and therefore He is absolutely nothing. For what is not one cannot exist
  either; because Being and unity are convertible terms, and whatever is
  one is. Even things which are made up of many items, such as a heap or
  chorus, are nevertheless a unity. Now we openly and honestly confess
  that Christ is; therefore we say that Christ is a Unity. And if this is
  so, then without controversy the Person of Christ is one also. For if
  the Persons were two He could not be one; but to say that there are two
  Christs is nothing else than the madness of a distraught brain. Could
  Nestorius, I ask, dare to call the one man and the one God in Christ two
  Christs? Or why does he call Him Christ who is God, if he is also going
  to call Him Christ who is man, when his combination gives the two no
  common factor, no coherence? Why does he wrongly use the same name for
  two utterly different natures, when, if he is compelled to define
  Christ, he cannot, as he himself admits, apply the substance of one
  definition to both his Christs? For if the substance of God is different
  from that of man, and the one name of Christ applies to both, and the
  combination of different substances is not believed to have formed one
  Person, the name of Christ is equivocal[66] and cannot be comprised in
  one definition. But in what Scriptures is the name of Christ ever made
  double? Or what new thing has been wrought by the coming of the Saviour?
  For the truth of the faith and the unwontedness of the miracle alike
  remain, for Catholics, unshaken. For how great and unprecedented a thing
  it isâ€”unique and incapable of repetition in any other ageâ€”that the
  nature of Him who is God alone should come together with human nature
  which was entirely different from God to form from different natures by
  conjunction a single Person! But now, if we follow Nestorius, what
  happens that is new? "Humanity and divinity," quoth he, "keep their
  proper Persons." Well, when had not divinity and humanity each its
  proper Person? And when, we answer, will this not be so? Or wherein is
  the birth of Jesus more significant than that of any other child, if,
  the two Persons remaining distinct, the natures also were distinct? For
  while the Persons remained so there could no more be a union of natures
  in Christ than there could be in any other man with whose substance, be
  it never so perfect, no divinity was ever united because of the
  subsistence of his proper person. But for the sake of argument let him
  call Jesus, i.e. the human person, Christ, because through that person
  God wrought certain wonders. Agreed. But why should he call God Himself
  by the name of Christ? Why should he not go on to call the very elements
  by that name? For through them in their daily movements God works
  certain wonders. Is it because irrational substances cannot possess a
  Person enabling them to receive the name of Christ? Is not the operation
  of God seen plainly in men of holy life and notable piety? There will
  surely be no reason not to call the saints also by that name, if Christ
  taking humanity on Him is not one Person through conjunction. But
  perhaps he will say, "I allow that such men are called Christs, but it
  is because they are in the image of the true Christ." But if no one
  Person has been formed of the union of God and man, we shall consider
  all of them just as true Christs as Him who, we believe, was born of a
  Virgin. For no Person has been made one by the union of God and man
  either in Him or in them who by the Spirit of God foretold the coming
  Christ, for which cause they too were called Christs. So now it follows
  that so long as the Persons remain, we cannot in any wise believe that
  humanity has been assumed by divinity. For things which differ alike in
  persons and natures are certainly separate, nay absolutely separate; man
  and oxen are not further separate than are divinity and humanity in
  Christ, if the Persons have remained. Men indeed and oxen are united in
  one animal nature, for by genus they have a common substance and the
  same nature in the collection which forms the universal.[67] But God and
  man will be at all points fundamentally different if we are to believe
  that distinction of Persons continues under difference of nature. Then
  the human race has not been saved, the birth of Christ has brought us no
  salvation, the writings of all the prophets have but beguiled the people
  that believed in them, contempt is poured upon the authority of the
  whole Old Testament which promised to the world salvation by the birth
  of Christ. It is plain that salvation has not been brought us, if there
  is the same difference in Person that there is in Nature. No doubt He
  saved that humanity which we believe He assumed; but no assumption can
  be conceived, if the separation abides alike of Nature and of Person.
  Hence that human nature which could not be assumed as long as the Person
  continued, will certainly and rightly appear incapable of salvation by
  the birth of Christ. Wherefore man's nature has not been saved by the
  birth of Christâ€”an impious conclusion.[68]</p>

euagatus, in contrarium cucurrit errorem asserens tantum abesse, ut in
Christo gemina persona credatur, ut ne naturam quidem in eo duplicem
oporteat confiteri; ita quippe esse adsumptum hominem, ut ea sit adunatio
facta cum deo, ut natura humana non manserit. Huius error ex eodem quo
Nestorii fonte prolabitur. Nam sicut Nestorius arbitratur non posse esse
naturam duplicem quin persona fieret duplex, atque ideo, cum in Christo
naturam duplicem confiteretur, duplicem credidit esse personam, ita quoque
Eutyches non putauit naturam duplicem esse sine duplicatione personae et
cum non confiteretur duplicem esse personam, arbitratus est consequens, ut
una uideretur esse natura. Itaque Nestorius recte tenens duplicem in
Christo esse naturam sacrilege confitetur duas esse personas; Eutyches uero
recte credens unam esse personam impie credit unam quoque esse naturam. Qui
conuictus euidentia rerum, quandoquidem manifestum est aliam naturam esse
hominis aliam dei, ait duas se confiteri in Christo naturas ante

uult eloquitur. Vt tamen eius dementiam perscrutemur, adunatio haec aut
tempore generationis facta est aut tempore resurrectionis. Sed si tempore
generationis facta est, uidetur putare et ante generationem fuisse humanam
carnem non a Maria sumptam sed aliquo modo alio praeparatam, Mariam uero
uirginem appositam ex qua caro nasceretur quae ab ea sumpta non esset,
illam uero carnem quae antea fuerit esse et diuisam atque a diuinitatis
substantia separatam; cum ex uirgine natus est, adunatum esse deo, ut una
uideretur facta esse natura. Vel si haec eius sententia non est, illa esse
poterit dicentis duas ante adunationem, unam post adunationem, si adunatio
generatione perfecta est, ut corpus quidem a Maria sumpserit, sed, antequam
sumeret, diuersam deitatis humanitatisque fuisse naturam; sumptam uero unam
factam atque in diuinitatis cessisse substantiam. Quod si hanc adunationem
non putat generatione sed resurrectione factam, rursus id duobus fieri
arbitrabitur modis; aut enim genito Christo et non adsumente de Maria
corpus aut adsumente ab eadem carnem, usque dum resurgeret quidem, duas
fuisse naturas, post resurrectionem unam factam. De quibus illud disiunctum
nascitur, quod interrogabimus hoc modo: natus ex Maria Christus aut ab ea
carnem humanam traxit aut minime. Si non confitetur ex ea traxisse, dicat
quo homine indutus aduenerit, utrumne eo qui deciderat praeuaricatione
peccati an alio? Si eo de cuius semine ductus est homo, quem uestita
diuinitas est? Nam si ex semine Abrahae atque Dauid et postremo Mariae non
fuit caro illa qua natus est, ostendat ex cuius hominis sit carne
deriuatus, quoniam post primum hominem caro omnis humana ex humana carne
deducitur. Sed si quem dixerit hominem a quo generatio sumpta sit
saluatoris praeter Mariam uirginem, et ipse errore confundetur et
adscribere mendacii notam summae diuinitati inlusus ipse uidebitur, quando
quod Abrahae atque Dauid promittitur in sanctis diuinationibus, ut ex eorum
semine toti mundo salus oriatur, aliis distribuit, cum praesertim, si
humana caro sumpta est, non ab alio sumi potuerit nisi unde etiam
procreabatur. Si igitur a Maria non est sumptum corpus humanum sed a
quolibet alio, per Mariam tamen est procreatum quod fuerat praeuaricatione
corruptum, superius dicto repellitur argumento. Quod si non eo homine
Christus indutus est qui pro peccati poena sustinuerat mortem, illud
eueniet ex nullius hominis semine talem potuisse nasci qui fuerit sine
originalis poena peccati. Ex nullo igitur talis sumpta est caro; unde fit
ut nouiter uideatur esse formata. Sed haec aut ita hominum uisa est oculis,
ut humanum putaretur corpus quod reuera non esset humanum, quippe quod
nulli originali subiaceret poenae, aut noua quaedam uera nec poenae peccati
subiacens originalis ad tempus hominis natura formata est? Si uerum hominis
corpus non fuit, aperte arguitur mentita diuinitas, quae ostenderet
hominibus corpus, quod cum uerum non esset, tum fallerentur ii[69] qui
uerum esse arbitrarentur. At si noua ueraque non ex homine sumpta caro
formata est, quo tanta tragoedia generationis? Vbi ambitus passionis? Ego
quippe ne in homine quidem non stulte fieri puto quod inutiliter factum
est. Ad quam uero utilitatem facta probabitur tanta humilitas diuinitatis,
si homo qui periit generatione ac passione Christi saluatus non est,
quoniam negatur adsumptus? Rursus igitur sicut ab eodem Nestorii fonte
Eutychis error principium sumpsit, ita ad eundem finem relabitur, ut
secundum Eutychen quoque non sit saluatum genus humanum, quoniam non is qui
aeger esset et saluatione curaque egeret, adsumptus est. Traxisse autem
hanc sententiam uidetur, si tamen huius erroris fuit ut crederet non fuisse
corpus Christi uere ex homine sed extra atque adeo in caelo formatum,
quoniam cum eo in caelum creditur ascendisse. Quod exemplum continet tale:
"non ascendit in caelum, nisi qui de caelo descendit."</p>

<p id="id00315" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I must now pass to Eutyches who, wandering from the path of primitive
  doctrine, has rushed into the opposite error[70] and asserts that so far
  from our having to believe in a twofold Person in Christ, we must not
  even confess a double Nature; humanity, he maintains, was so assumed
  that the union with Godhead involved the disappearance of the human
  nature. His error springs from the same source as that of Nestorius. For
  just as Nestorius deems there could not be a double Nature unless the
  Person were doubled, and therefore, confessing the double Nature in
  Christ, has perforce believed the Person to be double, so also Eutyches
  deemed that the Nature was not double unless the Person was double, and
  since he did not confess a double Person, he thought it a necessary
  consequence that the Nature should be regarded as single. Thus
  Nestorius, rightly holding Christ's Nature to be double, sacrilegiously
  professes the Persons to be two; whereas Eutyches, rightly believing the
  Person to be single, impiously believes that the Nature also is single.
  And being confuted by the plain evidence of facts, since it is clear
  that the Nature of God is different from that of man, he declares his
  belief to be: two Natures in Christ before the union and only one after
  the union. Now this statement does not express clearly what he means.
  However, let us scrutinize his extravagance. It is plain that this union
  took place either at the moment of conception or at the moment of
  resurrection. But if it happened at the moment of conception, Eutyches
  seems to think that even before conception He had human flesh, not taken
  from Mary but prepared in some other way, while the Virgin Mary was
  brought in to give birth to flesh that was not taken from her; that this
  flesh, which already existed, was apart and separate from the substance
  of divinity, but that when He was born of the Virgin it was united to
  God, so that the Nature seemed to be made one. Or if this be not his
  opinion, since he says that there were two Natures before the union and
  one after, supposing the union to be established by conception, an
  alternative view may be that Christ indeed took a body from Mary but
  that before He took it the Natures of Godhead and manhood were
  different: but the Nature assumed became one with that of Godhead into
  which it passed. But if he thinks that this union was effected not by
  conception but by resurrection, we shall have to assume that this too
  happened in one of two ways; either Christ was conceived and did
  <i>not</i> assume a body from Mary or He <i>did</i> assume flesh from
  her, and there were (until indeed He rose) two Natures which became one
  after the Resurrection. From these alternatives a dilemma arises which
  we will examine as follows: Christ who was born of Mary either did or
  did not take human flesh from her. If Eutyches does not admit that He
  took it from her, then let him say what manhood He put on to come among
  usâ€”that which had fallen through sinful disobedience or another? If it
  was the manhood of that man from whom all men descend, what manhood did
  divinity invest? For if that flesh in which He was born came not of the
  seed of Abraham and of David and finally of Mary, let Eutyches show from
  what man's flesh he descended, since, after the first man, all human
  flesh is derived from human flesh. But if he shall name any child of man
  beside Mary the Virgin as the cause of the conception of the Saviour, he
  will both be confounded by his own error, and, himself a dupe, will
  stand accused of stamping with falsehood the very Godhead for thus
  transferring to others the promise of the sacred oracles made to Abraham
  and David[71] that of their seed salvation should arise for all the
  world, especially since if human flesh was taken it could not be taken
  from any other but Him of whom it was begotten. If, therefore, His human
  body was not taken from Mary but from any other, yet that was engendered
  through Mary which had been corrupted by disobedience, Eutyches is
  confuted by the argument already stated. But if Christ did not put on
  that manhood which had endured death in punishment for sin, it will
  result that of no man's seed could ever one have been born who should
  be, like Him, without punishment for original sin. Therefore flesh like
  His was taken from no man, whence it would appear to have been new-
  formed for the purpose. But did this flesh then either so appear to
  human eyes that the body was deemed human which was not really human,
  because it was not subject to any primal penalty, or was some new true
  human flesh formed as a makeshift, not subject to the penalty for
  original sin? If it was not a truly human body, the Godhead is plainly
  convicted of falsehood for displaying to men a body which was not real
  and thus deceived those who thought it real.  But if flesh had been
  formed new and real and not taken from man, to what purpose was the
  tremendous tragedy of the conception? Where the value of His long
  Passion? I cannot but consider foolish even a human action that is
  useless. And to what useful end shall we say this great humiliation of
  Divinity was wrought if ruined man has not been saved by the conception
  and the Passion of Christâ€”for they denied that he was taken into
  Godhead? Once more then, just as the error of Eutyches took its rise
  from the same source as that of Nestorius, so it hastens to the same
  goal inasmuch as according to Eutyches also the human race has not been
  saved,[72] since man who was sick and needed health and salvation was
  not taken into Godhead. Yet this is the conclusion he seems to have
  drawn, if he erred so deeply as to believe that Christ's body was not
  taken really from man but from a source outside him and prepared for the
  purpose in heaven, for He is believed to have ascended with it up into
  heaven. Which is the meaning of the text: none hath ascended into heaven
  save Him who came down from heaven.</p>

<p id="id00320">Sed satis de ea parte dictum uidetur, si corpus quod Christus excepit ex
Maria non credatur adsumptum. Si uero adsumptum est ex Maria neque
permansit perfecta humana diuinaque natura, id tribus effici potuit modis:
aut enim diuinitas in humanitatem translata est aut humanitas in
diuinitatem aut utraeque in se ita temperatae sunt atque commixtae, ut
neutra substantia propriam formam teneret. Sed si diuinitas in humanitatem
translata est, factum est, quod credi nefas est, ut humanitate inmutabili
substantia permanente diuinitas uerteretur et quod passibile atque mutabile
naturaliter exsisteret, id inmutabile permaneret, quod uero inmutabile
atque inpassibile naturaliter creditur, id in rem mutabilem uerteretur. Hoc
igitur fieri nulla ratione contingit. Sed humana forsitan natura in
deitatem uideatur esse conuersa. Hoc uero qui fieri potest, si diuinitas in
generatione Christi et humanam animam suscepit et corpus? Non enim omnis
res in rem omnem uerti ac transmutari potest. Nam cum substantiarum aliae
sint corporeae, aliae incorporeae, neque corporea in incorpoream neque
incorporea in eam quae corpus est mutari potest, nec uero incorporea in se
inuicem formas proprias mutant; sola enim mutari transformarique in se
possunt quae habent unius materiae commune subiectum, nec haec omnia, sed
ea quae in se et facere et pati possunt. Id uero probatur hoc modo: neque
enim potest aes in lapidem permutari nec uero idem aes in herbam nec
quodlibet aliud corpus in quodlibet aliud transfigurari potest, nisi et
eadem sit materia rerum in se transeuntium et a se et facere et pati
possint, ut, cum uinum atque aqua miscentur, utraque sunt talia quae actum
sibi passionemque communicent. Potest enim aquae qualitas a uini qualitate
aliquid pati; potest item uini ab aquae qualitate aliquid pati. Atque
idcirco si multum quidem fuerit aquae, uini uero paululum, non dicuntur
inmixta, sed alterum alterius qualitate corrumpitur. Si quis enim uinum
fundat in mare, non mixtum est mari uinum sed in mare corruptum, idcirco
quoniam qualitas aquae multitudine sui corporis nihil passa est a qualitate
uini, sed potius in se ipsam uini qualitatem propria multitudine
commutauit. Si uero sint mediocres sibique aequales uel paulo inaequales
naturae quae a se facere et pati possunt, illae miscentur et mediocribus
inter se qualitatibus temperantur. Atque haec quidem in corporibus neque
his omnibus, sed tantum quae a se, ut dictum est, et facere et pati possunt
communi atque eadem materia subiecta. Omne enim corpus quod in generatione
et corruptione subsistit communem uidetur habere materiam, sed non omne ab
omni uel in omni uel facere aliquid uel pati potest. Corpora uero in
incorporea nulla ratione poterunt permutari, quoniam nulla communi materia
subiecta participant quae susceptis qualitatibus in alterutram permutetur.
Omnis enim natura incorporeae substantiae nullo materiae nititur
fundamento; nullum uero corpus est cui non sit materia subiecta. Quod cum
ita sit cumque ne ea quidem quae communem materiam naturaliter habent in se
transeant, nisi illis adsit potestas in se et a se faciendi ac patiendi,
multo magis in se non permutabuntur quibus non modo communis materia non
est, sed cum alia res materiae fundamento nititur ut corpus, alia omnino
materiae subiecto non egeat ut incorporeum.</p>

<p id="id00321">Non igitur fieri potest, ut corpus in incorporalem speciem permutetur, nec
uero fieri potest, ut incorporalia in sese commixtione aliqua permutentur.
Quorum enim communis nulla materia est, nec in se uerti ac permutari
queunt. Nulla autem est incorporalibus materia rebus; non poterunt igitur
in se inuicem permutari. Sed anima et deus incorporeae substantiae recte
creduntur; non est igitur humana anima in diuinitatem a qua adsumpta est
permutata. Quod si neque corpus neque anima in diuinitatem potuit uerti,
nullo modo fieri potuit, ut humanitas conuerteretur in deum. Multo minus
uero credi potest, ut utraque in sese confunderentur, quoniam neque
incorporalitas transire ad corpus potest neque rursus e conuerso corpus ad
incorporalitatem, quando quidem nulla his materia subiecta communis est
quae alterutris substantiarum qualitatibus permutetur.</p>

<p id="id00322">At hi ita aiunt ex duabus quidem naturis Christum consistere, in duabus
uero minime, hoc scilicet intendentes, quoniam quod ex duabus consistit ita
unum fieri potest, ut illa ex quibus dicitur constare non maneant; ueluti
cum mel aquae confunditur neutrum manet, sed alterum alterius copulatione
corruptum quiddam tertium fecit, ita illud quidem quod ex melle atque aqua
tertium fit constare ex utrisque dicitur, in utrisque uero negatur. Non
enim poterit in utrisque constare, quando utrorumque natura non permanet.
Ex utrisque enim constare potest, licet ea ex quibus coniungitur alterutra
qualitate corrupta sint; in utrisque uero huiusmodi constare non poterit,
quoniam ea quae in se transfusa sunt non manent ac non sunt utraque in
quibus constare uideatur, cum ex utrisque constet in se inuicem qualitatum
mutatione transfusis.</p>

<p id="id00323">Catholici uero utrumque rationabiliter confitentur, nam et ex utrisque
naturis Christum et in utrisque consistere. Sed id qua ratione dicatur,
paulo posterius explicabo. Nunc illud est manifestum conuictam esse
Eutychis sententiam eo nomine, quod cum tribus modis fieri possit, ut ex
duabus naturis una subsistat, ut aut diuinitas in humanitatem translata sit
aut humanitas in diuinitatem aut utraque permixta sint, nullum horum modum
fieri potuisse superius dicta argumentatione declaratur.</p>

<h2 id="id00324" style="margin-top: 4em">  VI.</h2>

<p id="id00325" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  I think enough has been said on the supposition that we should believe
  that the body which Christ received was not taken from Mary. But if it
  was taken from Mary and the human and divine natures did not continue,
  each in its perfection, this may have happened in one of three ways.
  Either Godhead was translated into manhood, or manhood into Godhead, or
  both were so modified and mingled that neither substance kept its proper
  form. But if Godhead was translated into manhood, that has happened
  which piety forbids us to believe, viz. while the manhood continued in
  unchangeable substance Godhead was changed, and that which was by nature
  passible and mutable remained immutable, while that which we believe to
  be by nature immutable and impassible was changed into a mutable thing.
  This cannot happen on any show of reasoning. But perchance the human
  nature may seem to be changed into Godhead. Yet how can this be if
  Godhead in the conception of Christ received both human soul and body?
  Things cannot be promiscuously changed and interchanged. For since some
  substances are corporeal and others incorporeal, neither can a corporeal
  substance be changed into an incorporeal, nor can an incorporeal be
  changed into that which is body, nor yet incorporeals interchange their
  proper forms; for only those things can be interchanged and transformed
  which possess the common substrate of the same matter, nor can all of
  these so behave, but only those which can act upon and be acted on by
  each other. Now this is proved as follows: bronze can no more be
  converted into stone than it can be into grass, and generally no body
  can be transformed into any other body unless the things which pass into
  each other have a common matter and can act upon and be acted on by each
  other, as when wine and water are mingled both are of such a nature as
  to allow reciprocal action and influence. For the quality of water can
  be influenced in some degree by that of wine, similarly the quality of
  wine can be influenced by that of water. And therefore if there be a
  great deal of water but very little wine, they are not said to be
  mingled, but the one is ruined by the quality of the other. For if you
  pour wine into the sea the wine is not mingled with the sea but is lost
  in the sea, simply because the quality of the water owing to its bulk
  has been in no way affected by the quality of the wine, but rather by
  its own bulk has changed the quality of the wine into water. But if the
  natures which are capable of reciprocal action and influence are in
  moderate proportion and equal or only slightly unequal, they are really
  mingled and tempered by the qualities which are in moderate relation to
  each other. This indeed takes place in bodies but not in all bodies, but
  only in those, as has been said, which are capable of reciprocal action
  and influence and have the same matter subject to their qualities. For
  all bodies which subsist in conditions of birth and decay seem to
  possess a common matter, but all bodies are not capable of reciprocal
  action and influence. But corporeals cannot in any way be changed into
  incorporeals because they do not share in any common underlying matter
  which can be changed into this or that thing by taking on its qualities.
  For the nature of no incorporeal substance rests upon a material basis;
  but there is no body that has not matter as a substrate. Since this is
  so, and since not even those things which naturally have a common matter
  can pass over into each other unless they have the power of acting on
  each other and being acted upon by each other, far more will those
  things not suffer interchange which not only have no common matter but
  are different in substance, since one of them, being body, rests on a
  basis of matter, while the other, being incorporeal, cannot possibly
  stand in need of a material substrate.</p>

<p id="id00326" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  It is therefore impossible for a body to be changed into an incorporeal
  species, nor will it ever be possible for incorporeals to be changed
  into each other by any process of mingling. For things which have no
  common matter cannot be changed and converted one into another. But
  incorporeal things have no matter; they can never, therefore, be changed
  about among themselves. But the soul and God are rightly believed to be
  incorporeal substances; therefore the human soul has not been converted
  into the Godhead by which it was assumed. But if neither body nor soul
  can be turned into Godhead, it could not possibly happen that manhood
  should be transformed into God. But it is much less credible that the
  two should be confounded together since neither can incorporality pass
  over to body, nor again, contrariwise, can body pass over into
  incorporality when these have no common matter underlying them which can
  be converted by the qualities of one of two substances.</p>

<p id="id00327">  But the Eutychians say that Christ consists indeed of two natures, but
  not in two natures, meaning, no doubt, thereby, that a thing which
  consists of two elements can so far become one, that the elements of
  which it is said to be made up disappear; just as, for example, when
  honey is mixed with water neither remains, but the one thing being
  spoilt by conjunction with the other produces a certain third thing, so
  that third thing which is produced by the combination of honey and water
  is said to consist of both, but not in both. For it can never consist in
  both so long as the nature of both does not continue. For it can consist
  of both even though each element of which it is compounded has been
  spoiled by the quality of the other; but it can never consist in both
  natures of this kind since the elements which have been transmuted into
  each other do not continue, and both the elements in which it seems to
  consist cease to be, since it consists of two things translated into
  each other by change of qualities.</p>

<p id="id00328" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  But Catholics in accordance with reason confess both, for they say that
  Christ consists both of and in two natures. How this can be affirmed I
  will explain a little later. One thing is now clear; the opinion of
  Eutyches has been confuted on the ground that, although there are three
  ways by which the one nature can subsist of the two, viz. either the
  translation of divinity into humanity or of humanity into divinity or
  the compounding of both together, the foregoing train of reasoning
  proves that no one of the three ways is a possibility.</p>
