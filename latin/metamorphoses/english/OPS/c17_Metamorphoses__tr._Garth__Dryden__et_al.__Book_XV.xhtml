Where <i>Æsaris</i> rowls down his rapid Flood:<br/>
He said; and Sleep forsook him, and the God.<br/>
Trembling he wak'd, and rose with anxious Heart;<br/>
His Country Laws forbad him to depart:<br/>
What shou'd he do? 'Twas Death to go away,<br/>
And the God menac'd, if he dar'd to stay.<br/>
All Day he doubted, and when Night came on,<br/>
Sleep, and the same forewarning Dream, begun:<br/>
Once more the God stood threatning o'er his Head;<br/>
With added Curses if he disobey'd.<br/>
Twice warn'd, he study'd Flight; but wou'd convey,<br/>

<p>For this eternal World is said, of old,<br/>
But four prolifick Principles to hold,<br/>
Four different Bodies, two to Heav'n ascend,<br/>
And other two down to the Center tend:<br/>
Fire first with Wings expanded mounts on high,<br/>
Pure, void of Weight, and dwells in upper Sky;<br/>
Then Air, because unclog'd in empty Space,<br/>
Flies after Fire, and claims the second Place:<br/>
But weighty Water, as her Nature guides,<br/>
Lies on the lap of Earth, and Mother Earth subsides.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>All things are mix'd of these, which all contain,<br/>
And into these are all resolv'd again:<br/>
Earth rarifies to Dew; expanded more,<br/>
The subtil Dew in Air begins to soar;<br/>
Spreads, as she flies, and weary of her Name<br/>
Extenuates still, and changes into Flame;<br/>
Thus having by degrees Perfection won,<br/>
Restless they soon untwist the Web, they spun,<br/>
And Fire begins to lose her radiant Hue,<br/>
Mix'd with gross Air, and Air descends to Dew;<br/>
And Dew condensing, does her Form forego,<br/>
And sinks, a heavy lump of Earth, below.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Thus are their Figures never at a stand,<br/>
But chang'd by Nature's innovating Hand;<br/>
All things are alter'd, nothing is destroy'd,<br/>
The shifted Scene for some new Show employ'd.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Then, to be born, is to begin to be<br/>
Some other Thing we were not formerly:<br/>
And what we call to die, is not t' appear,<br/>
Or be the Thing, that formerly we were.<br/>
Those very Elements, which we partake<br/>
Alive, when dead some other Bodies make:<br/>
Translated grow, have Sense, or can Discourse;<br/>
But Death on deathless Substance has no Force.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>That Forms are chang'd, I grant; that nothing can<br/>
Continue in the Figure it began:

Maugre all Shocks, eternal, and secure:<br/>
There, on perennial Adamant design'd,<br/>
The various Fortunes of your Race you'll find:<br/>
