To wing your Course along the <span style="cursor:help; border-bottom:thin dotted cornflowerblue;" title="[sic] 'middle'">midde</span> Air;<br/>
If low, the Surges wet your flagging Plumes,<br/>
If high, the Sun the melting Wax consumes:<br/>
Steer between both: Nor to the Northern Skies,<br/>
Nor South <i>Orion</i> turn your giddy Eyes;<br/>
But follow me: Let me before you lay<br/>
Rules for the Flight, and mark the pathless Way.<br/>
Then teaching, with a fond Concern, his Son,<br/>
He took the untry'd Wings, and fix'd 'em on;<br/>
But fix'd with trembling Hands; and, as he speaks,<br/>
The Tears roul gently down his aged Cheeks.<br/>
Then kiss'd, and in his Arms embrac'd him fast,<br/>

With Brush-wood, and with Chips she strengthens these,<br/>
