<p>But when the Cyphers, figur'd in each Fold,<br/>
Her Sister's melancholly Story told,<br/>

The tragick Piece, and without weeping read:<br/>
In such tumultuous Haste her Passions sprung,<br/>
They choak'd her Voice, and quite disarm'd her Tongue.<br/>
No Room for female Tears; the <i>Furies</i> rise,<br/>
Darting vindictive Glances from her Eyes;<br/>
And, stung with Rage, she bounds from Place to Place,<br/>
While stern Revenge sits low'ring in her Face.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Now the triennial Celebration came,<br/>

By Night, the twinkling Cymbals ring around,<br/>
While the shrill Notes from <i>Rhodopè</i> resound;<br/>
By Night, the Queen, disguis'd, forsakes the Court,<br/>
To mingle in the Festival Resort.<br/>
Leafs of the curling Vine her Temples shade,<br/>
And, with a circling Wreath, adorn her Head:<br/>
Adown her Back the Stag's rough Spoils appear,<br/>
Light on her Shoulder leans a Cornel Spear.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Thus, in the Fury of the God conceal'd,<br/><i>Procné</i> her own mad headstrong Passion veil'd;<br/>
Now, with her Gang, to the thick Wood she flies,<br/>
And with religious Yellings fills the Skies;<br/>
The fatal Lodge, as 'twere by chance, she seeks,<br/>
And, thro' the bolted Doors, an Entrance breaks;<br/>
From thence, her Sister snatching by the Hand,<br/>
Mask'd like the ranting <i>Bacchanalian</i> Band,<br/>
Within the Limits of the Court she drew,<br/>
Shading, with Ivy green, her outward Hue.<br/>
But <i>Philomela</i>, conscious of the Place,<br/>
Felt new reviving Pangs of her Disgrace;<br/>
A shiv'ring Cold prevail'd in ev'ry Part,<br/>
And the chill'd Blood ran trembling to her Heart.
