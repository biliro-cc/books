He seems to grasp me, but as often fails.<br/>

Inflam'd with equal Love, and equal Rage;<br/>
Each claims the fairest Heifer of the Grove,<br/>
And Conquest only can decide their Love:<br/>
The trembling Herds survey the Fight from far,<br/>
Till Victory decides th' important War.<br/>
Three times in vain he strove my Joints to wrest,<br/>
To force my Hold, and throw me from his Breast;<br/>
The fourth he broke my Gripe, that clasp'd him round,<br/>
Then with new Force he stretch'd me on the Ground;<br/>
Close to my Back the mighty Burthen clung,<br/>
As if a Mountain o'er my Limbs were flung.<br/>
Believe my Tale; nor do I, boastful, aim<br/>
By feign'd Narration to extol my Fame.<br/>
No sooner from his Grasp I Freedom get,<br/>
Unlock my Arms, that flow'd with trickling Sweat,<br/>
But quick he seiz'd me, and renew'd the Strife,<br/>
As my exhausted Bosom pants for Life:<br/>

Rose not in Flames, nor kindled to Desire;<br/>

Hang on his Neck, and languish in his Arms;<br/>

For him alone she labour'd to be fair,<br/>
And curst all Charms that might with hers compare.<br/>
'Twas she, and only she, must <i>Caunus</i> please,<br/>
Sick at her Heart, yet knew not her Disease:<br/>

And when he spoke, if Sister, he reply'd,<br/>
For <i>Byblis</i> change that frozen Word, she cry'd.<br/>
Yet waking still she watch'd her strugling Breast,<br/>
And Love's Approaches were in vain address'd,<br/>
Till gentle Sleep an easy Conquest made,<br/>
And in her soft Embrace the Conqueror was laid.<br/>
But oh too soon the pleasing Vision fled,<br/>
And left her blushing on the conscious Bed:<br/>
Ah me! (she cry'd) how monstrous do I seem?<br/>
Why these wild thoughts? and this incestuous Dream?

Oppress'd with Grief, and dying by Disdain?<br/>
Ah no! too sure I shou'd have eas'd his Pain!<br/>

Asking my self, what Dangers can I run?<br/>
But canst thou ask? and see that Right betray'd,<br/>
From <i>Pyrrha</i> down to thy whole Sex convey'd?<br/>
That self-denying Gift we all enjoy,<br/>
Of wishing to be won, yet seeming to be coy.<br/>
Well then, for once, let a fond Mistress woe,<br/>
The Force of Love no Custom can subdue;<br/>
This frantick Passion he by Words shall know,<br/>
Soft as the melting Heart from whence they flow.<br/>
The Pencil then in her fair Hand she held,<br/>
By Fear discourag'd, but by Love compell'd;<br/>
She writes, then blots, writes on, and blots again,<br/>
Likes it as fit, then razes it as vain:<br/>
Shame, and Assurance in her Face appear,<br/>
And a faint Hope just yielding to Despair;<br/>
Sister was wrote, and blotted as a Word<br/>
Which she, and <i>Caunus</i> too (she hop'd) abhorr'd;<br/>
But now resolv'd to be no more controul'd<br/>
By scrup'lous Virtue, thus her Grief she told.

To thee a helpless vanquish'd Wretch I come,<br/>

No Foe; but one, alas! too near ally'd,<br/>

And Virtue's Rules by their cold Morals state;<br/>
Their ebbing Joys give Leisure to enquire,<br/>
And blame those noble Flights our Youth inspire;<br/>
Where Nature kindly summons let us go,<br/>
Our sprightly Years no Bounds in Love shou'd know,<br/>
Shou'd feel no Check of Guilt, and fear no Ill;<br/>
Lovers, and Gods act all things at their Will:

And Truth was cover'd with a pious Cheat.<br/>
The Habit shew'd a Boy, the beauteous Face<br/>
With manly Fierceness mingled Female Grace.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Now thirteen Years of Age were swiftly run,<span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:6em;">⁠</span><span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>
When the fond Father thought the Time drew on<br/>
Of settling in the World his only Son.<br/><i>Ianthe</i> was his Choice; so wondrous fair,<br/>
Her Form alone with <i>Iphis</i> cou'd compare;<br/>
A Neighbour's Daughter of his own Degree,<br/>
And not more bless'd with Fortune's Goods than he.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>They soon espous'd; for they with ease were join'd,<br/>
Who were before contracted in the Mind.<br/>
Their Age the same, their Inclinations too;<br/>
And bred together, in one School they grew.<br/>
Thus, fatally dispos'd to mutual Fires,<br/>
They felt, before they knew, the same Desires.<br/>
Equal their Flame, unequal was their Care;<br/>
One lov'd with Hope, one languish'd in Despair.<br/>
The Maid accus'd the lingring Day alone:<br/>
For whom she thought a Man, she thought her own.<br/>
But <i>Iphis</i> bends beneath a greater Grief;<br/>
As fiercely burns, but hopes for no Relief.

The Daughter of the Sun a Bull desir'd,<br/>
And yet ev'n then a Male a Female fir'd:<br/>
Her Passion was extravagantly new,<br/>
But mine is much the madder of the two.<br/>
To things impossible she was not bent,<br/>
But found the Means to compass her Intent.<br/>
To cheat his Eyes she took a different Shape;<br/>
Yet still she gain'd a Lover, and a Leap.<br/>
Shou'd all the Wit of all the World conspire,<br/>
Shou'd <i>Dædalus</i> assist my wild Desire,<br/>

Or what can change <i>Ianthe</i> to a Boy?

Our Parents with our own Desires agree;<br/>
But Nature, stronger than the Gods above,<br/>

She sets the Bar that causes all my Pain;<br/>

The trembling Timbrel made a murm'ring Sound.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Some Hopes these happy Omens did impart;<br/>
