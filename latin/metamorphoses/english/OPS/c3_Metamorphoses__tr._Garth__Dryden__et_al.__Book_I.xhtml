<p>A lifeless Lump, unfashion'd, and unfram'd, <br/>
Of jarring Seeds; and justly <i>Chaos</i> nam'd. <br/>
No Sun was lighted up the World to view; <br/>
No Moon did yet her blunted Horns renew: <br/>
Nor yet was Earth suspended in the Sky; <br/>
Nor pois'd, did on her own Foundations lye: <br/>
Nor Seas about the Shores their Arms had thrown; <br/>
But Earth, and Air, and Water, were in one. <br/>
Thus Air was void of Light, and Earth unstable, <br/>
And Water's dark abyss unnavigable.<br/>
No certain Form on any was imprest; <br/>
All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest. <br/>
For hot and cold were in one Body fixt; <br/>
And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt. <br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>But God, or Nature, while they thus contend, <br/>
To these intestine Discords put an end: <br/>
Then Earth from Air, and Seas from Earth were driv'n, <br/>
And grosser Air sunk from Ætherial Heav'n. <br/>
Thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place;<span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:6em;">⁠</span><span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span> <br/>
The next of Kin, contiguously embrace;<br/>
And Foes are sunder'd, by a larger Space. <br/>
The Force of Fire ascended first on high, <br/>
And took its Dwelling in the vaulted Sky: <br/>
Then Air succeeds, in Lightness next to Fire; <br/>
Whose Atoms from unactive Earth retire. <br/>
Earth sinks beneath, and draws a num'rous Throng <br/>
Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy Seeds along. <br/>
About her Coasts, unruly Waters roar; <br/>
And, rising on a Ridge, insult the Shore. <br/>
Thus when the God, whatever God was he,<br/>
Had form'd the Whole, and made the Parts agree, <br/>
That no unequal Portions might be found, <br/>
He moulded Earth into a spacious Round: <br/>
Then with a breath, he gave the Winds to blow; <br/>
And bad the congregated Waters flow.

And Thunder's Voice, which wretched Mortals fear, <br/>
And Winds that on their Wings cold Winter bear. <br/>
Nor were those blustring Brethren left at large, <br/>
On Seas, and Shores, their Fury to discharge: <br/>
Bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in place, <br/>
They rend the World, resistless, where they pass;<br/>
And mighty Marks of Mischief leave behind; <br/>
Such is the Rage of their tempestuous kind. <br/>
First <i>Eurus</i> to the rising Morn is sent, <br/>
(The Regions of the balmy Continent;) <br/>
And <i>Eastern</i> Realms, where early <i>Persians</i> run, <br/>
To greet the blest appearance of the Sun. <br/><i>Westward</i>, the wanton <i>Zephyr</i> wings his Flight; <br/>
Pleas'd with the Remnants of departing Light: <br/>
Fierce <i>Boreas</i>, with his Off-spring, issues forth <br/>

Content with Food, which Nature freely bred, <br/>

Cornels and Bramble-berries gave the rest, <br/>
And falling Acorns furnish'd out a Feast. <br/>

<p>The Clamours of this vile degenerate Age, <br/>
The Cries of Orphans, and th' Oppressor's Rage <br/>
Had reach'd the Stars: I will descend, said I, <br/>
In hope to prove this loud Complaint a Lye. <br/>
Disguis'd in Humane Shape, I travell'd round <br/>
The World, and more than what I heard, I found. <br/>
O'er <i>Mænalus</i> I took my steepy Way,<br/>
By Caverns infamous for Beasts of Prey: <br/>
Then cross'd <i>Cyllené</i>, and the piny Shade <br/>
More infamous, by curst <i>Lycaon</i> made. <br/>
Dark Night had cover'd Heav'n, and Earth, before <br/>
I enter'd his unhospitable Door. <br/>
Just at my entrance, I display'd the Sign <br/>
That something was approaching of Divine. <br/>
The prostrate People pray; the Tyrant grins; <br/>
And, adding Prophanation to his Sins, <br/>
I'll try, said he, and if a God appear,<br/>
To prove his Deity shall cost him dear. <br/>
'Twas late; the graceless Wretch my Death prepares, <br/>
When I shou'd soundly sleep, opprest with Cares: <br/>
This dire Experiment he chose, to prove <br/>
If I were Mortal, or undoubted <i>Jove</i>: <br/>
But first he had resolv'd to taste my Pow'r; <br/>
Not long before, but in a luckless Hour<br/>
Some Legates, sent from the <i>Molossian</i> State <br/>
Were on a peaceful Errand come to treat: <br/>
Of these he murders one, he boils the Flesh;<br/>
And lays the mangled Morsels in a Dish: <br/>
Some part he roasts; then serves it up, so drest, <br/>
And bids me welcome to this humane Feast. <br/>
Mov'd with disdain, the Table I o'er-turn'd; <br/>
And with avenging Flames, the Palace burn'd. <br/>
The Tyrant in a Fright, for Shelter gains <br/>
The neighb'ring Fields, and scours along the Plains. <br/>
Howling he fled, and fain he wou'd have spoke; <br/>
But humane Voice his brutal Tongue forsook.

For some new Sense; and long they fought in vain:<br/>
At length <i>Deucalion</i> clear'd his cloudy Brow,<br/>
And said, the dark <i>Ænigma</i> will allow<br/>
A Meaning, which if well I understand,<br/>

Supplying Humours, Blood, and Nourishment;<br/>
The Rest, too solid to receive the Bent,<br/>

Sooths him with Blandishments, and filial Charms: <br/>

A spotless Maid, without the Marriage Tye. <br/>

But <i>Inachus</i>, who in his Cave, alone, <br/>
Wept not another's Losses, but his own. <br/>

And in the Language of her Eyes, she spoke. <br/>
She wou'd have told her Name, and ask'd relief, <br/>

Which, with her Foot she makes him understand; <br/>

<p>She tries her Tongue; her Silence softly breaks,<br/>
And fears her former Lowings when she speaks:<br/>
A Goddess now, through all th' <i>Ægyptian</i> State:<br/>
And serv'd by Priests, who in white Linnen wait.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Her Son was <i>Epaphus</i>, at length believ'd<br/>
The Son of <i>Jove</i>, and as a God receiv'd;<br/>
With Sacrifice ador'd, and publick Pray'rs,<br/>
He common Temples with his Mother shares.<br/>
Equal in Years, and Rival in Renown <span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:6em;">⁠</span><span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>
With <i>Epaphus</i>, the youthful <i>Phaeton</i><br/>
Like Honour claims; and boasts his Sire the Sun.<br/>
His haughty Looks, and his assuming Air,<br/>
The son of <i>Isis</i> cou'd no longer bear:<br/>
Thou tak'st thy Mother's Word too far, said he,<br/>
And hast usurp'd thy boasted Pedigree.<br/>
Go, base Pretender to a borrow'd Name.<br/>
Thus tax'd, he blush'd with Anger, and with Shame;<br/>
But Shame repress'd his Rage: The daunted Youth<br/>
Soon seeks his Mother, and enquires the Truth:<br/>
Mother, said he, this Infamy was thrown<br/>
By <i>Epaphus</i> on you, and me your Son.<br/>
He spoke in publick, told it to my Face;<br/>
Nor durst I vindicate the dire Disgrace:<br/>
Even I, the bold, the sensible of Wrong,<br/>
Restrain'd by Shame, was forc'd to hold my Tongue.<br/>
To hear an open Slander, is a Curse:<br/>
But not to find an Answer, is a worse.<br/>
If I am Heav'n-begot, assert your Son <span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:6em;">⁠</span><span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>
By some sure Sign; and make my Father known,<br/>
To right my Honour, and redeem your own.<br/>
He said, and saying cast his Arms about<br/>
Her Neck, and beg'd her to resolve the Doubt.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>'Tis hard to judge if <i>Clymenè</i> were mov'd<br/>
More by his Pray'r, whom she so dearly lov'd,<br/>
Or more with Fury fir'd, to find her Name<br/>
Traduc'd, and made the Sport of common Fame.

<p>She stretch'd her Arms to Heav'n, and fix'd her Eyes <br/>
On that fair Planet, that adorns the Skies; <br/>
Now by those Beams, said she, whose holy Fires <br/>
Consume my Breast, and kindle my Desires; <br/>
By him, who sees us both, and chears our Sight, <br/>
By him, the publick Minister of Light,<br/>
I swear that <i>Sun</i> begot thee; if I lye, <br/>
Let him his chearful Influence deny: <br/>
Let him no more this perjur'd Creature see; <br/>
And shine on all the World, but only me. <br/>
If still you doubt your Mother's Innocence, <br/>
His Eastern Mansion is not far from hence; <br/>
With little Pains you to his <i>Levè</i> go, <br/>
And from himself your Parentage may know. <br/>
With joy th' ambitious Youth his Mother heard, <br/>
And eager, for the Journey soon prepar'd.<br/>
He longs the World beneath him to survey; <br/>
To guide the Chariot; and to give the Day. <br/>
From <i>Meroe</i><span style="padding-left:.05em">'</span>s burning Sands he bends his Course, <br/>
Nor less in <i>India</i> feels his Father's Force: <br/>
His Travel urging, till he came in Sight; <br/>
And saw the Palace by the Purple Light.
