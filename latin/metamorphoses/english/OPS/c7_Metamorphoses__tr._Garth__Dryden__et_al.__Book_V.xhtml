Your frantick Mind so black a Crime conceive?<br/>
Are these the Thanks that you to <i>Perseus</i> give?<br/>
This the Reward that to his Worth you pay,<br/>
Whose timely Valour sav'd <i>Andromeda</i>?<br/>

And that devouring Monster of the Sea,<br/>
That ready with his Jaws wide-gaping stood<br/>
To eat my Child, the fairest of my Blood.<br/>

And wish'd perhaps her Death, to ease your Grief<br/>
With my Afflictions: Not content to view<br/><i>Andromeda</i> in Chains, unhelp'd by you,<br/>
Her Spouse, and Uncle; will you grieve that he<br/>
Expos'd his Life the dying Maid to free?<br/>
And shall you claim his Merit? Had you thought<br/>
Her Charms so great, you shou'd have bravely sought<br/>
That Blessing on the Rocks, where fix'd she lay:<br/>
But now let <i>Perseus</i> bear his Prize away,<br/>
By Service gain'd, by promis'd Faith possess'd;<br/>
