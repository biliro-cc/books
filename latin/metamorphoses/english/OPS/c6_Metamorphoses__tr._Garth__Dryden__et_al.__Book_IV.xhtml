With rich Oblations fragrant Altars blaze.<br/>
Sweet Wreaths of choicest Flow'rs are hung on high,<br/>
And cloudless Pleasure smiles in ev'ry Eye.<br/>
The melting Musick melting Thoughts inspires,<br/>
And warbling Songsters aid the warbling Lyres.<br/>
The Palace opens wide in pompous State,<br/>
And by his Peers surrounded, <i>Cepheus</i> sate.<br/>
A Feast was serv'd fit for a King to give,<br/>
And fit for God-like Heroes to receive.<br/>
The Banquet ended, the gay, chearful Bowl<br/>
Mov'd round, and brighten'd, and enlarg'd each Soul.<br/>
Then <i>Perseus</i> ask'd, what Customs there obtain'd,<br/>
And by what Laws the People were restrain'd.<br/>
Which told; the Teller a like Freedom takes,<span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>

He stretch'd his Hand, and stole their mutual Light,<br/>
And left both Eyeless both involv'd in Night.<br/>
Thro' devious Wilds, and trackless Woods he past,<br/>
And at the <i>Gorgon</i>-Seats arriv'd at last;<br/>
But as he journey'd, pensive he survey'd,<br/>
What wasteful Havock dire <i>Medusa</i> made.<br/>
Here, stood still breathing Statues, Men before;<br/>
There, rampant Lions seem'd in Stone to roar.

And from her Body lop'd at once her Head.<br/>

Sigh'd at the Pause of his delightful Tongue.<br/>

A rival Crowd of envious Lovers strove.<br/>

More moving Features in a sweeter Face.<br/>
Yet above all, her length of Hair they own,<br/>
In golden Ringlets wav'd, and graceful shone.<br/>
