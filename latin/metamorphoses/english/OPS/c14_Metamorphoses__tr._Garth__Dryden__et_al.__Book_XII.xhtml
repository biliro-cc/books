And cry'd, not long, lov'd <i>Crantor</i>, shalt thou wait<br/>
Thy vow'd Revenge. At once he said, and threw<br/>
His Ashen-Spear which quiver'd as it flew;<br/>

Both Hands to wrench it out the Monster join'd;<br/>

His Head; his other Hand the Lance protends.<br/>
Ev'n while he lay extended on the Dust,<br/>

Two more, his Lance before transfix'd from far;<br/>
And two, his Sword had slain, in closer War.<br/>
To these was added <i>Dorylas</i>, who spread<br/>
A Bull's two goring Horns around his Head.<br/>

Him, fearless, I approach'd; and thus defy'd:<br/>
Now, Monster, now, by Proof it shall appear,<br/>
Whether thy Horns are sharper, or my Spear.<br/>
At this, I threw: For want of other Ward,<br/>

<p>To him, our common Grandsire of the Main,<br/>
Had giv'n to change his Form, and chang'd, resume again.<br/>
Vary'd at Pleasure, every Shape he try'd;<br/>
And in all Beasts, <i>Alcides</i> still defy'd:<br/>
Vanquish'd on Earth, at length he soar'd above;<br/>
Chang'd to the Bird, that bears the Bolt of <i>Jovè</i>:<br/>
The new-dissembled Eagle, now endu'd<br/>
With Beak, and Pounces, <i>Hercules</i> pursu'd,<br/>
And cuff'd his manly Cheeks, and tore his Face;<br/>
Then, safe retir'd, and tour'd in empty space.<br/><i>Alcides</i> bore not long his flying Foe;<br/>
But bending his inevitable Bow,<br/>
Reach'd him in Air, suspended as he stood;<br/>
And in his Pinion fix'd the feather'd Wood.<br/>
Light was the Wound; but in the Sinew hung<br/>
The Point; and his disabled Wing unstrung,<br/>
He wheel'd in Air, and stretch'd his Vans in vain;<br/>
His Vans no longer cou'd his Flight sustain:<br/>
For while one gathered Wind, one unsupply'd<br/>
Hung drooping down, nor pois'd the other Side.<br/>
He fell: The Shaft that slightly was impress'd,<br/>
Now from his heavy Fall with weight increas'd,<br/>
Drove through his Neck aslant; he spurns the Ground,<br/>
And the Soul issues through the Weazon's Wound.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Now, brave Commander of the <i>Rhodian</i> Seas,<br/>
What Praise is due from me, to <i>Hercules</i>?<br/>
Silence is all the Vengeance I decree<br/>
For my slain Brothers; but 'tis Peace with thee.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Thus with a flowing Tongue old <i>Nestor</i> spoke:<br/>
Then, to full Bowls each other they provoke:<br/>
At length, with Weariness, and Wine oppress'd,<br/>
They rise from Table; and withdraw to Rest.<br/><br/></p>

Mean time, laments his Son, in Battel slain,<br/>
And vows the Victor's Death; nor vows in vain.<br/>
For nine long Years the smother'd Pain he bore;<br/>
{<i>Achilles</i> was not ripe for Fate, before:)<br/>
Then when he saw the promis'd Hour was near,<br/>
He thus bespoke the God, that guides the Year.<br/>
Immortal Offspring of my Brother <i>Jove</i>;<br/>
My brightest Nephew, and whom best I love,<br/>
Whose Hands were join'd with mine, to raise the Wall<br/>
Of tottring <i>Troy</i>, now nodding to her Fall,<br/>
Dost thou not mourn our Pow'r employ'd in vain;<br/>
And the Defenders of our City slain?<br/>
To pass the rest, cou'd noble <i>Hector</i> lie<br/>
Unpity'd, drag'd around his Native <i>Troy</i>?<br/>
And yet the Murd'rer lives: Himself by far<br/>
A greater Plague, than all the wasteful War:<br/>
He lives; the proud <i>Pelides</i> lives, to boast<br/>
Our Town destroy'd, our common Labour lost,<br/>
O, could I meet him! But I wish too late:<br/>
To prove my Trident is not in his Fate!<br/>
But let him try (for that's allow'd) thy Dart,<br/>
And pierce his only penetrable Part.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span><i>Apollo</i> bows to the superior Throne;<br/>
And to his Uncle's Anger, adds his own.<br/>
Then in a Cloud involv'd, he takes his Flight,<br/>
Where <i>Greeks</i>, and <i>Trojans</i> mix'd in mortal Fight;<br/>
And found out <i>Paris</i>, lurking where he stood,<br/>
And stain'd his Arrows with <i>Plebeian</i> Blood:<br/><i>Phœbus</i> to him alone the God confess'd,<br/>
Then to the recreant Knight, he thus address'd.<br/>
Dost thou not blush, to spend thy Shafts in vain<br/>
On a degenerate, and ignoble Train?

And to the <i>Grecian</i> Chiefs transferr'd the Cause.
