When I from <i>Hector</i><span style="padding-left:.05em">'</span>s Hands redeem'd the flaming Prey. <br/>
So much 'tis safer at the noisie Bar <br/>
With Words to flourish, than ingage in War. <br/>
By diff'rent Methods we maintain our Right, <br/>
Nor am I made to Talk, nor he to Fight. <br/>
In bloody Fields I labour to be great; <br/>
His Arms are a smooth Tongue, and soft Deceit: <br/>
Nor need I speak my Deeds, for those you see, <br/>
The Sun, and Day are Witnesses for me. <br/>
Let him who fights unseen, relate his own, <br/>
And vouch the silent Stars, and conscious Moon. <br/>
Great is the Prize demanded, I confess, <br/>
But such an abject Rival makes it less; <br/>
That Gift, those Honours, he but hop'd to gain, <br/>
Can leave no room for <i>Ajax</i> to be vain: <br/>
Losing he wins, because his Name will be <br/>
Ennobled by Defeat, who durst contend with me. <br/>
Were my known Valour question'd, yet my Blood <br/>
Without that Plea wou'd make my Title good: <br/>
My Sire was <i>Telamon</i>, whose Arms, employ'd <br/>
With <i>Hercules</i>, these <i>Trojan</i> Walls destroy'd; <br/>
And who before with <i>Jason</i>, sent from <i>Greece</i>, <br/>
In the first Ship brought home the Golden Fleece. <br/>
Great <i>Telamon</i> from <i>Æacus</i> derives <br/>
His Birth (th' Inquisitor of guilty Lives <br/>
In Shades below; where <i>Sisyphus</i>, whose Son, <br/>
This Thief is thought, rouls up the restless heavy Stone.)<br/>
Just <i>Æacus</i>, the King of Gods above <br/>
Begot : Thus <i>Ajax</i> is the third from Jove,<br/>
Nor shou'd I seek Advantage from my Line,<br/>
Unless {<i>Achilles</i>) it were mix'd with thine: <br/>
As next of Kin <i>Achilles</i><span style="padding-left:.05em">'</span> Arms I claim; <br/>

Pale, trembling, and half dead with Fear of Death,<br/>
Though he had judg'd himself by his own Laws,<br/>
And stood condemn'd, I help'd the common Cause:<br/>
With my broad Buckler hid him from the Foe;<br/>

Which I have now reduc'd to Certainty;<br/>

And by their taken Gods, which now are ours;<br/>
Or if there yet a farther Task remains,<br/>

If yet some desp'rate Action rests behind,<br/>

Yet still may plead some Merit, if my Light<br/>
With Purple Dawn controuls the Pow'rs of Night;<br/>
If from a Female Hand that Virtue springs,<br/>
Which to the Gods, and Men such Pleasure brings.<br/>

Nipt in the Bud, and blasted in his Prime;<br/>
Who for his Uncle early took the Field,<br/>
And by <i>Achilles</i><span style="padding-left:.05em">'</span> fatal Spear was kill'd.<br/>
To whom but <i>Jove</i> shou'd I for Succour come?<br/>
For <i>Jove</i> alone cou'd fix his cruel Doom.<br/>
O Sov'reign of the Gods, accept my Pray'r,<br/>
Grant my Request, and sooth a Mother's Care;<br/>

To expiate the Loss, and ease my Woe.

<p>Amaz'd, within my secret Self I sought,<br/>
What God, what Herb the Miracle had wrought:<br/>
But sure no Herbs have Pow'r like this, I cry'd;<br/>
And strait I pluck'd some neighb'ring Herbs, and try'd.<br/>
Scarce had I bit, and prov'd the wond'rous Taste,<br/>
When strong Convulsions shook my troubled Breast;<br/>
I felt my Heart grow fond of something strange,<br/>
And my whole Nature lab'ring with a Change.<br/>
Restless I grew, and ev'ry Place forsook,<br/>
And still upon the Seas I bent my Look.<br/>
Farewel for ever! Farewel, Land! I said;<br/>
And plung'd amidst the Waves my sinking Head.<br/>
The gentle Pow'rs, who that low Empire keep,<br/>
Receiv'd me as a Brother of the Deep;<br/>
To <i>Tethys</i>, and to <i>Ocean</i> old, they pray<br/>
To purge my mortal Earthy Parts away.<br/>
The watry Parents to their Suit agreed,<br/>
And thrice nine times a secret Charm they read.<br/>
Then with Lustrations purify my Limbs,<br/>
And bid me bath beneath a hundred Streams:<br/>
A hundred Streams from various Fountains run,<br/>
And on my Head at once come rushing down.<br/>
Thus far each Passage I remember well,<span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:6em;">⁠</span><span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>
And faithfully thus far the Tale I tell;<br/>
But then Oblivion dark, on all my Senses fell.<br/>
Again at length my Thought reviving came,<br/>
When I no longer found my self the same;<br/>
Then first this Sea-green Beard I felt to grow,<br/>
And these large Honours on my spreading Brow;<br/>
My long descending Locks the Billows sweep,<br/>
And my broad Shoulders cleave the yielding Deep;<br/>
My Fishy Tail, my Arms of Azure Hue,<br/>
And ey'ry Part divinely chang'd, I view.
