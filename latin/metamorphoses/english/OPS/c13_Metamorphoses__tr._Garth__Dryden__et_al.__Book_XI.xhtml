See, see! the Hater of our Sex, she cry'd.<br/>
Then at his Face her missive Javelin sent,<br/>
Which whiz'd along, and brusht him as it went;<br/>
But the soft Wreaths of Ivy twisted round,<br/>
Prevent a deep Impression of the Wound.<br/>
Another, for a Weapon, hurls a Stone,<br/>
Which, by the Sound subdu'd as soon as thrown,<br/>
Falls at his Feet, and with a seeming Sense<br/>
Implores his Pardon for its late Offence.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>But now their frantick Rage unbounded grows,<br/>
Turns all to Madness, and no Measure knows:<br/>
Yet this the Charms of Musick might subdue,<br/>
But that, with all its Charms, is conquer'd too;<br/>
In louder Strains their hideous Yellings rise,<br/>
And squeaking Horn-pipes eccho thro' the Skies,<br/>
Which, in hoarse Consort with the Drum, confound<br/>
The moving Lyre, and ev'ry gentle Sound:<br/>
Then 'twas the deafen'd Stones flew on with Speed,<br/>
And saw, unsooth'd, their tuneful Poet bleed.<br/>
The Birds, the Beasts, and all the Savage Crew<br/>
Which the sweet Lyrist to Attention drew,<br/>
Now, by the Female Mob's more furious Rage,<br/>
Are driv'n, and forc'd to quit the shady Stage.<br/>
Next their fierce Hands the Bard himself assail,<br/>
Nor can his Song against their Wrath prevail:<br/>
They flock, like Birds; when, in a clustring Flight,<br/>
By Day they chase the boding Fowl of Night.<br/>
So, crowded Amphitheatres survey<br/>
The Stag to greedy Dogs a future Prey,<br/>
Their steely Javelins, which soft Curls entwine<br/>
Of budding Tendrils from the leafy Vine,<br/>
For sacred Rites of mild Religion made,<br/>
Are flung promiscuous at the Poet's Head.<br/>
Those Clods or Earth of Flints discharge, and these<br/>
Hurl prickly Branches sliver'd from the Trees.

Too much the Offer leaves me in your Debt.<br/>
No Arms against the Monster I shall bear,<br/>

The mangled Heifers lye, and bleeding Men;<br/>
Th' inexorable Ravager they view,<br/>
With Blood discolour'd, still the rest pursue:<br/>
There <i>Peleus</i> pray'd submissive tow'rds the Sea,<br/>
And deprecates the Ire of injur'd <i>Psamathè</i>.<br/>

Deep in a Cavern, dwells the drowzy God;<br/>
Whose gloomy Mansion nor the rising Sun,<br/>
Nor setting, visits, nor the lightsome Noon;<br/>
But lazy Vapours round the Region fly,<br/>
Perpetual Twilight, and a doubtful Sky:<br/>
No crowing Cock does there his Wings display,<br/>
Nor with his horny Bill provoke the Day;<br/>
Nor watchful Dogs, nor the more wakeful Geese,<br/>
Disturb with nightly Noise the sacred Peace;<br/>
Nor Beast of Nature, nor the Tame are nigh,<br/>
Nor Trees with Tempests rock'd, nor human Cry;<br/>
But safe Repose without an Air of Breath<br/>
Dwells here, and a dumb Quiet next to Death.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>An Arm of <i>Lethe</i>, with a gentle Flow<br/>
Arising upwards from the Rock below,<br/>
The Palace moats, and o'er the Pebbles creeps,<br/>
And with soft Murmurs calls the coming Sleeps.<br/>
Around its Entry nodding Poppies grow,<br/>
And all cool Simples that sweet Rest bestow;<br/>
Night from the Plants their sleepy Virtue drains,<br/>
And passing, sheds it on the silent Plains:<br/>
No Door there was th' unguarded House to keep,<br/>
On creaking Hinges turn'd, to break his Sleep.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>But in the gloomy Court was rais'd a Bed,<br/>
Stuff'd with black Plumes, and on an Ebon-Sted:<br/>
Black was the Cov'ring too, where lay the God,<br/>
And slept supine, his Limbs display'd abroad:<br/>
About his Head fantastick Visions fly,<br/>
Which various Images of things supply,<br/>
And mock their Forms; the Leaves on Trees not more,<br/>
Nor bearded Ears in Fields, nor Sands upon the Shore.

Accursed Snake! yet I more curs'd than he!<br/>
He gave the Wound; the Cause was given by me.<br/>
Yet none shall say, that unreveng'd you dy'd.<span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:6em;">⁠</span><span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>
He spoke; then climb'd a Cliff's o'er-hanging Side,<br/>
And, resolute, leap'd on the foaming Tide.

<p><i>Tethys</i> receiv'd him gently on the Wave;<br/>
The Death he sought deny'd, and Feathers gave.<br/>
Debarr'd the surest Remedy of Grief,<br/>
And forced to live, he curst th' unask'd Relief.<br/>
Then on his airy Pinions upward flies,<span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>
And at a second Fall successless tries;<br/>
The downy Plume a quick Descent denies.<br/>
Enrag'd, he often dives beneath the Wave,<br/>
And there in vain expects to find a Grave.<br/>
His ceaseless Sorrow for th' unhappy Maid,<br/>
Meager'd his Look, and on his Spirits prey'd.<br/>
Still near the sounding Deep he lives; his Name<br/>
From frequent Diving and Emerging came.
