I climb'd a neighb'ring Hill to view the Chase,<br/>
While in the Plain they held an equal Race;<br/>
The Savage now seems caught, and now by Force<br/>
To quit himself, nor holds the same strait Course;<br/>
But running counter, from the Foe withdraws,<br/>
And with short Turning cheats his gaping Jaws:<br/>
Which he retrieves, and still so closely prest,<br/>
You'd fear at ev'ry Stretch he were possess'd;<br/>
Yet for the Gripe his Fangs in vain prepare,<br/>
The Game shoots from him, and he chops the Air.<br/>
To cast my Jav'lin then I took my Stand;<br/>
But as the Thongs were fitting to my Hand,<br/>
While to the Valley I o'er-look'd the Wood,<br/>
Before my Eyes two Marble Statues stood;<br/>
That, as pursu'd, appearing at full Stretch,<br/>
This barking after, and at point to catch:<br/>
Some God their Course did with this Wonder grace,<br/>
That neither might be conquer'd in the Chase.<br/>
A sudden Silence here his Tongue supprest,<br/>
He here stops short, and fain wou'd wave the rest.
