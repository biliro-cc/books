No rapid Motion can its Flames awake. <br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>With Dread these inauspicious Signs were view'd, <br/>
And soon a more disastrous End ensu'd; <br/>
For as the Bride, amid the <i>Naiad</i> Train, <br/>
Ran joyful, sporting o'er the flow'ry Plain, <br/>
A venom'd Viper bit her as she pass'd; <br/>
Instant she fell, and suddain breath'd her last. <br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>When long his Loss the <i>Thracian</i> had deplor'd, <br/>

Inflam'd by Love, and urg'd by deep Despair, <br/>

Daring to tread the dark <i>Tenarian</i> Road, <br/>
And tempt the Shades in their obscure Abode;<br/>
Thro' gliding Spectres of th' Interr'd to go, <br/>
And Phantom People of the World below: <br/><i>Persephonè</i> he seeks, and him who reigns <br/>
O'er Ghosts, and Hell's uncomfortable Plains. <br/>
Arriv'd, he, tuning to his Voice his Strings, <br/>

Nor come to boast (by vain Ambition fir'd) <br/>
How <i>Cerberus</i> at my Approach retir'd. <br/>
My Wife alone I seek; for her lov'd sake <br/>
These Terrors I support, this Journey take. <br/>
She, luckless wandring, or by Fate misled, <br/>
Chanc'd on a lurking Viper's Crest to tread; <br/>
The vengeful Beast, enflam'd with Fury, starts, <br/>
And thro' her Heel his deathful Venom darts. <br/>
Thus was she snatch'd untimely to her Tomb; <br/>
Her growing Years cut short, and springing Bloom. <br/>
Long I my Loss endeavour'd to sustain, <br/>

<p>At length I yielded, won by mighty Love; <br/>
Well known is that Omnipotence above! <br/>
But here, I doubt, his unfelt Influence fails; <br/>
And yet a Hope within my Heart prevails,<br/>
That here, ev'n here, he has been known of old; <br/>
At least, if Truth be by Tradition told;  <br/>
If Fame of former Rapes Belief may find, <br/>
You both by Love, and Love alone, were join'd. <br/>
Now, by the Horrors which these Realms surround; <br/>
By the vast Chaos of these Depths profound; <br/>
By the sad Silence which eternal reigns <br/>
O'er all the Waste of these wide-stretching Plains; <br/>
Let me again <i>Eurydice</i> receive,<br/>
Let Fate her quick-spun Thread of Life re-weave. <br/>
All our Possessions are but Loans from you, <br/>
And soon, or late, you must be paid your Due; <br/>
Hither we haste to Human-kind's last Seat, <br/>
Your endless Empire, and our sure Retreat. <br/>
She too, when ripen'd Years she shall attain, <br/>
Must, of avoidless Right, be yours again: <br/>
I but the transient use of that require,<br/>
Which soon, too soon, I must resign entire.  <br/>
But if the Destinies refuse my Vow, <br/>
And no remission of her Doom allow; <br/>
Know, I'm determin'd to return no more;  <br/>
So both retain, or both to Life restore. <br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Thus, while the Bard melodiously complains, <br/>
And to his Lyre accords his vocal Strains, <br/>
The very bloodless Shades Attention keep,  <br/>
And silent, seem compassionate to weep;  <br/>
Ev'n <i>Tantalus</i> his Flood unthirsty views, <br/>
Nor flies the Stream, nor he the Stream pursues;  <br/><i>Ixion</i><span style="padding-left:.05em">'</span>s wondring Wheel its Whirl suspends, <br/>
And the voracious Vultur, charm'd, attend; <br/>
No more the <i>Belides</i> their Toil bemoan, <br/>
And <i>Sisiphus</i> reclin'd, sits list'ning on his Stone.

Nor could the rigid King, or Queen of Hell, <br/>
Th' Impulse of Pity in their Hearts repel. <br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Now, from a Troop of Shades that last arriv'd, <br/><i>Eurydice</i> was call'd, and stood reviv'd. <br/>
Slow she advanc'd, and halting seem'd to feel <br/>
The fatal Wound, yet painful in her Heel. <br/>
Thus he obtains the Suit so much desir'd, <br/>
On strict Observance of the Terms requir'd: <br/>
For if, before he reach the Realms of Air, <br/>
He backward cast his Eyes to view the Fair, <br/>
The forfeit Grant, that Instant, void is made, <br/>
And she for ever left a lifeless Shade. <br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Now thro' the noiseless Throng their Way they bend, <br/>
And both with Pain the rugged Road ascend; <br/>
Dark was the Path, and difficult, and steep, <br/>
And thick with Vapours from the smoaky Deep. <br/>
They well-nigh now had pass'd the Bounds of Night, <br/>
And just approach'd the Margin of the Light, <br/>
When he, mistrusting lest her Steps might stray, <br/>
And gladsome of the Glympse of dawning Day, <br/>
His longing Eyes, impatient, backward cast <br/>
To catch a Lover's Look, but look'd his last; <br/>
For, instant dying, she again descends, <br/>
While he to empty Air his Arms extends. <br/>
Again she dy'd, nor yet her Lord reprov'd; <br/>
What could she say, but that too well he lov'd? <br/>
One last Farewel she spoke, which scarce he heard; <br/>
So soon she dropt, so sudden disappear'd, <br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>All stunn'd he stood, when thus his Wife he view'd <br/>
By second Fate, and double Death subdu'd: <br/>
Not more Amazement by that Wretch was shown,  <br/>
Whom <i>Cerberus</i> beholding, turn'd to Stone; <br/>
Nor <i>Olenus</i> cou'd more astonish'd look, <br/>
When on himself <i>Lethæa</i><span style="padding-left:.05em">'</span>s Fault he took.

But distant Groves the flying Sounds receive, <br/>
And listning Trees their rooted Stations leave; <br/>
Themselves transplanting, all around they grow, <br/>
And various Shades their various Kinds bestow. <br/>

But Man a Slave of his own making lives;<br/>
The Fool denies himself what Nature gives:<br/>
Too busie Senates, with an over Care<br/>
To make us better than our Kind can bear,<br/>
Have dash'd a Spice of Envy in the Laws,<br/>
And straining up too high, have spoil'd the Cause.<br/>
Yet some wise Nations break their cruel Chains,<br/>
And own no Laws, but those which Love ordains;<br/>
Where happy Daughters with their Sires are joyn'd<br/>
And Piety is doubly paid in Kind.

Beside the strugling Boughs, and heard the groaning Wood;<br/>

The Bark divides, the living Load to free,<br/>
And safe delivers the Convulsive Tree.<br/>
The ready Nymphs receive the crying Child,<br/>
And wash him in the Tears the Parent Plant distill'd.<br/>
They swath'd him with their Scarfs; beneath him spread<br/>
The Ground with Herbs; with Roses rais'd his Head.<br/>
The lovely Babe was born with ev'ry Grace,<br/>
Ev'n Envy must have prais'd so fair a Face:<br/>
Such was his Form, as Painters when they show<br/>
Their utmost Art, on naked Loves bestow:<br/>
And that their Arms no Diff'rence might betray,<br/>
Give him a Bow, or his from <i>Cupid</i> take away.<br/>
Time glides along with undiscover'd Haste,<br/>
The Future but a Length behind the Past;<br/>
So swift are Years. The Babe, whom just before<br/>
His Grandsire got, and whom his Sister bore;

Why beats, and pants my Breast for him alone?<br/>

<p>The flying Savage, wounded, turn'd again,<br/>
Wrench'd out the gory Dart, and foam'd with Pain.<br/>
The trembling Boy by Flight his Safety sought,<br/>
And now recall'd the Lore, which <i>Venus</i> taught:<br/>
But now too late to fly the Boar he strove,<br/>
Who in the Groin his Tusks impetuous drove,<br/>
On the discolour'd Grass <i>Adonis</i> lay,<br/>
The Monster trampling o'er his beauteous Prey.<br/><span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:1em;">⁠</span>Fair <i>Cytherëa</i>, <i>Cyprus</i> scarce in view,<span class="wst-gap __gap" style="display:inline-block; width:6em;">⁠</span><span class="wst-floatright" style="margin:0 0 0 0;"><img src="images/c27_bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183" class="mwe-math-fallback-image-inline" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -3.171ex; width:3.761ex; height:7.176ex;" alt="\scriptstyle {\left.{\begin{matrix}\ \\\\\ \ \end{matrix}}\right\}\,}" data-title="bab91f07e3740200c218ea4a7f62f0ad57781183"/></span><br/>
Heard from afar his Groans, and own'd them true,<br/>
And turn'd her snowy Swans, and backward flew.<br/>
But as she saw him gasp his latest Breath,<br/>
And quiv'ring agonize in Pangs of Death,<br/>
Down with swift Flight she plung'd, nor Rage forbore,<br/>
At once her Garments, and her Hair she tore.<br/>
With cruel Blows she beat her guiltless Breast,<br/>
The Fates upbraided, and her Love confest.<br/>
Nor shall they yet (she cry'd) the Whole devour<br/>
With uncontroul'd, inexorable Pow'r:<br/>
For thee, lost Youth, my Tears and restless Pain<br/>
Shall in immortal Monuments remain.<br/>
With solemn Pomp in annual Rites return'd,<br/>
Be thou for ever, my <i>Adonis</i>, mourn'd.<br/>
Could <i>Pluto</i><span style="padding-left:.05em">'</span>s Queen with jealous fury storm,<br/>
And <i>Menthé</i> to a fragrant Herb transform?<br/>
Yet dares not <i>Venus</i> with a Change surprise,<br/>
And in a Flow'r bid her fall'n Hero rise;<br/>
Then on the Blood sweet Nectar she bestows,<br/>
The scented Blood in little Bubbles rose:<br/>
Little, as rainy Drops, which flutt'ring fly,<br/>
Born by the Winds, along a low'ring Sky.<br/>
Short time ensu'd, till where the Blood was shed,<br/>
A Flow'r began to rear its purple Head:<br/>
Such, as on <i>Punick</i> Apples is reveal'd,<br/>
Or in the filmy Rind but half conceal'd.

<p>Still here the Fate of lovely Forms we see,<br/>
So sudden fades the sweet <i>Anemoniè</i>.<br/>
The feeble Stems, to stormy Blasts a Prey,<br/>
Their sickly Beauties droop, and pine away.<br/>
The Winds forbid the Flow'rs to flourish long,<br/>
Which owe to Winds their Names in <i>Grecian</i> Song.
