This Drusus, while holding the offices of quaestor and praetor, was in charge of the war in Rhaetia and later of that in Germany.  He was the first of Roman generals to sail the northern Ocean, and beyond the Rhine with prodigious labour he constructed the huge canals which to this very day are called by his name.<sup about="#mwt14" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-3-n504" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-3-n661" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 3;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[3]</span></a></sup>  Even after he had defeated the enemy in many battles and driven them far into the wilds of the interior, he did not cease his pursuit until the apparition of a barbarian woman of greater than human size, speaking in the Latin tongue, forbade him to push his victory futher.

The senate, in addition to many other honours, voted him a marble arch adorned with trophies on the Appian Way, and the surname Germanicus for himself and his descendants.

It is because of this, I think, that some have made bold to write that he was an object of suspicion to Augustus;  that the emperor recalled him from his province, and when he did not obey at once, took him off by poison.  This I have mentioned, rather not to pass it by, than that I think it true or even probable;  for as a matter of fact Augustus loved him so dearly while he lived that he was always named him joint-heir along with his sons, as he once declared in the senate;  and when he was dead, he eulogized him warmly before the people, praying the gods to make his Caesars<sup about="#mwt21" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-10-n511" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-10-n668" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 10;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[10]</span></a></sup> like Drusus, and to grant him, when his time came, as glorious a death as they had given that hero.  And not content with carving a laudatory inscription on his tomb in verses of his own composition, Augustus also wrote a memoir of his life in prose.</p>

<p>Drusus had several children by the younger Antonia, but was survived by only three, Germanicus, Livilla, and Claudius.</p>

<p>Claudius was born at Lugdunum on the Kalends of Augustus in the consulship of Iullus Antonius and Fabius Africanus, the very day when an altar was first dedicated to Augustus in that town,<sup about="#mwt25" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-11-n513" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-11-n669" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 11;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[11]</span></a></sup> and he received the name of Tiberius Claudius Drusus.  Later, on the adoption of his elder brother into the Julian family, he took the surname Germanicus.  He lost his father when he was still an infant, and throughout almost the whole course of his childhood and youth he suffered so severely from various obstinate disorders that the vigour of both his mind and his body was dulled, and even when he reached the proper age he was not thought capable of any public or private business.  For a long time, even after he reached the age of independence,<sup about="#mwt26" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-12-n514" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-12-n670" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 12;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[12]</span></a></sup> he was in a state of pupillage and under a guardian, of whom he himself makes complaint in a book of his, saying that he was a barbarian and a former chief of muleteers, put in charge of him for the express purpose of punishing him with all possible severity for any cause whatever.  It was also because of his weak health that contrary to all precedent he wore a cloak when he presided at the gladiatorial games which he and his brother gave in honour of their father;  and on the day when he assumed the gown of manhood he was taken in a litter to the Capitol about midnight without the usual escort.<sup about="#mwt27" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-13-n515" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-13-n671" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 13;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[13]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Yet he gave no slight attention to liberal studies from his earliest youth, and even published frequent specimens of his attainments in each line.  But even so he could not attain any public position or inspire more favourable hope of his future.</p>

<p>His mother Antonia often called him "a monster of a man, not finished but merely begun by Dame Nature";  and if she accused anyone of dullness, she used to say that he was "a bigger fool than her son Claudius."  His grandmother Augusta always treated him with the utmost contempt, very rarely speaking to him;  and when she admonished him, she did so in short, harsh letters, or through messengers.  When his sister Livilla heard that he would one day be emperor, she openly and loudly prayed that the Roman people might be spared so cruel and undeserved a fortune.  Finally to make it clearer what opinions, favourable and otherwise, his great uncle Augustus had of him, I have appended extracts from his own letters:</p>

But if we realize that he is wanting and defective in soundness of body and mind, we must not furnish the means of ridiculing both him and us to a public which is wont to scoff at and deride such things.  Surely we shall always be in a stew, if we deliberate about each separate occasion and do not make up our minds in advance whether we think he can hold public offices or not.  However, as to the matters about which you ask my present advice, I do not object to his having charge of the banquet of the priests at the games of Mars, if he will allow himself to be advised by his kinsman the son of Silvanus, so as not to do anything to make himself conspicuous or ridiculous.  That he should view the games in the Circus from the Imperial box<sup about="#mwt37" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-18-n522" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-18-n676" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 18;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[18]</span></a></sup> does not meet with my approval;  for he will be conspicuous if exposed to full view in front of the auditorium.  I am opposed to his going to the Alban Mount or being in Rome on the days of the Latin festival;  for why should he not be made prefect of the city, if he is able to attend his brother to the Mount?  You have my views, my dear Livia, to wit that I desire that something be decided once for all about the whole matter, to save us from constantly wavering between hope and fear.  Moreover, you may, if you wish, give this part of my letter to our kinswoman Antonia also to read."  Again in another letter:</p>

<p>"I certainly shall invite the young Tiberius to dinner every day during your absence, to keep him from dining alone with his friends Sulpicius and Athenodorus.  I do wish that he would choose more carefully and in a less scatter-brained fashion someone to imitate in his movements, bearing, and gait.  The poor fellow is unlucky;  for in important matters, where his mind does not wander, the nobility of his character is apparent enough."  Also in a third letter:</p>

<p>"Confound me, dear Livia, if I am not surprised that your grandson Tiberius could please me with his declaiming.  How in the world anyone who is so unclear in his conversation can speak with clearness and propriety when he declaims, is more than I can see."</p>

<p>There is no doubt at all what Augustus later decided, and that he left him invested with no office other than the augural priesthood, not even naming him as one of his heirs, save in the third degree<sup about="#mwt39" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-19-n523" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-19-n677" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 19;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[19]</span></a></sup> and to a sixth part of his estate, among those who were all but strangers;  while the legacy that he left him was not more than eight hundred thousand sesterces.</p>

Yet all this time, despite his conduct, he never lacked attention from individuals or respect from the public.</p>

<p>The equestrian order twice chose him as their patron, to head a deputation on their behalf:  once when they asked from the consuls the privilege of carrying the body of Augustus to Rome on their shoulders, and again when they offered them their congratulations on the downfall of Sejanus.  They even used to rise when he appeared at the public shows and put off their cloaks.

Yet when Tiberius died, he named Claudius only among his heirs in the third degree, to a third part of his estate, although he gave him in addition a legacy of about two million sesterces, and expressly commended him besides to the armies and to the senate and people of Rome with the rest of his kinsfolk.</p>

<p>But all this did not save him from constant insults;  for if he came to dinner a little after the appointed time, he took his place with difficulty and only after making the round of the dining-room.  Whenever he went to sleep after dinner, which was a habit of his, he was pelted with the stones of olives and dates, and sometimes he was awakened by the jesters with a whip or a cane, in pretended sport.  They used also to put slippers on his hands as he lay snoring, so that when he was suddenly aroused he might rub his face with them.</p>

<p>But he was exposed also to actual dangers.  First in his very consulship, when he was all but deposed, because he had been somewhat slow in contracting for and setting up the statues of Nero and Drusus, the emperor's brothers.

<p>Having spent the greater part of his life under these and like circumstances, he became emperor in his fiftieth year by a remarkable break of fortune.  When the assassins of Gaius shut out the crowd under pretence that the emperor wished to be alone, Claudius was ousted with the rest and withdrew to an apartment called the Hermaeum;  and a little later, in great terror at the news of the murder, he stole away to a balcony hard by and hid among the curtains which hung before the door.  As he cowered there, a common soldier, who was prowling about at random, saw his feet, intending to ask who he was, pulled him out and recognized him;  and when Claudius fell at his feet in terror, he hailed him as emperor.  Then he took him to the rest of his comrades, who were as yet in a condition of uncertainty and purposeless rage.  These placed him in a litter, took turns in carrying it, since his own bearers had made off, and bore him to the Camp in a state of despair and terror, while the throng that met him pitied him, as an innocent man who was being hurried off to execution.

He completed the marble arch to Tiberius near Pompey's theatre, which had been voted some time before by the senate, but left unfinished.

He recalled no one from exile except with the approval of the senate.  He obtained from the members as a favour the privilege of bringing into the House with him the prefect of the praetorian guard and the tribunes of the soldiers, and the ratification of the judicial acts of his agents in the provinces.  He asked the consuls for permission to hold fairs on his private estates.  He often appeared as one of the advisers at cases tried before the magistrates;  and when they gave games, he also arose with the rest of the audience and showed his respect by acclamations and applause.  When the tribunes of the commons appeared before him as he sat upon the tribunal, he apologised to them because for lack of room he could not hear them unless they stood up.</p>

<p>By such conduct he won so much love and devotion in a short time, that when it was reported that he had been waylaid and killed on a journey to Ostia, the people were horror stricken and with dreadful execrations continued to assail the soldiers as traitors, and the senate as murderers, until finally one or two men, and later several, were brought forward upon the rostra by the magistrates and assured the people that Claudius was safe and on his way to the city.</p>

<p>Yet he did not remain throughout without experience of treachery, but he was attacked by individuals, by a conspiracy, and finally by a civil war.  A man of the commons was caught near his bed-chamber in the middle of the night, dagger in hand;  and two members of the equestrian order were found lying in wait for him in public places, one ready to attack him with a sword-cane as he came out of the theatre, the other with a hunting knife as he was sacrificing in the temple of Mars.  Asinius Gallus and Statilus Corvinus, grandsons of the orators Pollio and Messala, conspired to overthrow him, aided by a number of his own freedmen and slaves.  The civil war was set on foot by Furius Camillus Scribonianus, governor of Dalmatia;  but his rebellion was put down within five days, since the legions which had changed their allegiance were turned from their purpose by superstitious fear;  for when the order was given to march to their new commander, by some providential chance the eagles could not be adorned<sup about="#mwt74" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-36-n549" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-36-n694" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 36;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[36]</span></a></sup> nor the standards pulled up and moved.<sup about="#mwt75" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-37-n550" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-37-n695" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 37;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[37]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>He held four consulships in addition to his original one.  Of these the first two were in successive years, while the other two followed at intervals of four years each, the last for six months, the others for two;  and in his third he was substituted for one of the consuls who had died, a thing which was without precedent in the case of an emperor.  He administered justice most conscientiously both as consul and when out of office, even on his own anniversaries and those of his family, and sometimes even on festivals of ancient date and days of ill-omen.  He did not always follow the letter of the laws, but modified their severity or lenity in many cases according to his own notions of equity and justice;  for he allowed a new trial to those who had lost their cases before private judges by demanding more than the law prescribed, while, overstepping the lawful penalty, he condemned to the wild beasts those who were convicted of especially heinous crimes.</p>

Another, who was challenged by his opponents about a suit of his own, said that it did not come before Caesar's tribunal, but the ordinary courts;  whereupon Claudius compelled him at once to bring the case before him, saying that the man would show in a case affecting his own interests how just a juror he would be in the affairs of others.  When a woman refused to recognise her son, the evidence on both sides was conflicting, he forced her to admit the truth by ordering her to marry the young man.  Whenever one party to a suit was absent, he was prone to decide in favour of the one who was present, without considering whether his opponent had failed to appear through his own fault or from a necessary cause.<sup about="#mwt84" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-41-n556" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-41-n699" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 41;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[41]</span></a></sup>  On a man's being convicted of forgery, some one cried out that his hands ought to be cut off;  whereupon Claudius insisted that an executioner be summoned at once with knife and block.

In one case he is credited with having rendered the following decision, which he had actually written out beforehand:  "I decide in favour of those who have told the truth."  By such acts as these he so discredited himself that he was held in general and open contempt.  One mna in making excuses for a witness that the emperor had summoned from one of the provinces, said that he could not appear, but for a long time would give no reason;  at last, after a long series of questions, he said:  "He's dead;  I think the excuse is a lawful one."  Another in thanking the emperor for allowing him to defend his client added "After all, it is usual."  I myself used to hear older men say that the pleaders took such advantage of his good-nature, that they would not only call him back when he left the tribunal, but would catch hold of the fringe of his robe, and sometimes of his foot, and thus detain him.  To prevent any surprise at this, I may add that a common Greek pettifogger let slip this remark in a hot debate:  "You are both an old man and a fool."  All the world knows that a Roman knight who was tried for improper conduct towards women, but on a false charge trumped up by unscrupulous enemies, seeing common strumpets called as witnesses against him and their testimony admitted, hurled the stylus and tablets which he held in his hand into the emperor's face with such force as to cut his cheek badly, at the same time loudly reviling his cruelty and stupidity.</p>

Another who was notorious for corruption and adultery he merely admonished to be more restrained in his indulgence, or at any rate more circumspect, adding, "For why should I know what mistress you keep?"  When he had removed the mark of censure affixed to one man's name, yielding to the entreaties of the latter's friends, he said:  "But let the erasure be seen."  He not only struck from the list of jurors a man of high birth, a leading citizen of the province of Greece, because he did not know Latin, but even deprived him of the rights of citizenship;  and he would not allow anyone to render an account of his life save in his own words, as well as he could, without the help of an advocate.

When he attempted to degrade still more, he found them in most cases blameless;  for owing to the great carelessness of his agents, but to his own greater shame, those whom he accused of celibacy, childlessness, or lack of means proved that they were married, or fathers, or well-to-do.  In fact, one man, who was charged with having stabbed himself, stripped off his clothing and showed a body without a scar.

<p>He made but one campaign and that of little importance.  When the senate voted him the triumphal regalia, thinking the honour beneath imperial dignity and desiring the glory of a legitimate triumph, he chose Britain as the best place for gaining it, a land that had been attempted by no one since the Deified Julius and was just at that time in a state of rebellion because of the refusal to return certain deserters.  On the voyage thither from Ostia he was nearly cast away twice in furious north-westers, off Liguria and near the Stoechades islands.  Therefore he made the journey from Massilia all the way to Gesoriacum by land, crossed from there, and without any battle or bloodshed received the submission of a part of the island, returned to Rome within six months after leaving the city, and celebrated a triumph of great splendour.  To witness the sight he allowed not only the governors of the provinces to come to Rome, but even some of the exiles;  and among the tokens of his victory he set a naval crown on the gable of the Palace beside the civic crown, as a sign that he had crossed and, as it were, subdued the Ocean.  His wife Messalina followed his chariot in a carriage, as did also those who had won the triumphal regalia in the same war;  the rest marched on foot in purple-bordered togas, except Marcus Crassus Frugi, who rode a caparisoned horse and wore a tunic embroidered with palms, because he was receiving the honour for the second time.</p>

When there was a scarcity of grain because of the long-continued droughts, he was once stopped in the middle of the Forum by a mob and so pelted with abuse and at the same time with pieces of bread, that he was barely able to make his escape to the Palace by a back door;  and after this experience he resorted to every possible means to bring grain to Rome, even in the winter season.

<p>The public works which he completed were great and essential rather than numerous;  they were in particular the following:  an aqueduct begun by Gaius;  also the outlet of Lake Fucinus and the harbour at Ostia, although in the case of the last two he knew that Augustus had refused the former to the Marsians in spite of their frequent requests, and that the latter had often been thought of by the Deified Julius, but given up because of its difficulty.  He brought to the city on stone arches the cool and abundant founts of the Claudian aqueduct, one of which is called Caeruleus and the other Curtius and Albudignus, and at the same time the spring of the new Anio, distributing them into many beautifully ornamented pools.  He made the attempt on the Fucine lake as much in the hope of gain as of glory, inasmuch as there were some who agreed to drain it at their own cost, provided that the land that was uncovered be given to them.  He finished the outlet, which was three miles in length, partly by levelling and partly by tunnelling a mountain, a work of great difficulty and requiring eleven years, although he had thirty thousand men on the right and left, while before the entrance he placed a mole in deep water.

<p>He was betrothed twice at an early age:  to Aemilia Lepida, great-granddaughter of Augustus, and to Livia Medullina, who also had the surname of Camilla and was descended from the ancient family of Camillus the dictator.  He put away the former before their marriage, because her parents had offended Augustus;  the latter was taken ill and died on the very day which had been set for the wedding.  He then married Plautia Urgulanilla, whose father had been honoured with a triumph, and later Aelia Paetina, daughter of an ex-consul.  He divorced both these, Paetina for trivial offences, but Urgulanilla because of scandalous lewdness and the suspicion of murder.  Then he married Valeria Messalina, daughter of his cousin Messala Barbatus.  But when he learned that besides other shameful and wicked deeds she had actually married Gaius Silius, and that a formal contract had been signed in the presence of witnesses, he put her to death and declared before the assembled praetorian guard that inasmuch as his marriages did not turn out well, he would remain a widower, and if he did not keep his word, he would not refuse death at their hands.  Yet he could not refrain from at once planning another match, even with Paetina, whom he had formerly discarded, and with Lollia Paulina, who had been the wife of Gaius Caesar.  But his affections were ensnared by the wiles of Agrippina, daughter of his brother Germanicus, aided by the right of exchanging kisses and the opportunities for endearments offered by their relationship;  and at the next meeting of the senate he induced some of the members to propose that he be compelled to marry Agrippina, on the ground that it was for the interest of the State;  also that others be allowed to contract similar marriages, which up to that time had been regarded as incestuous.  And he married her with hardly a single day's delay;  but none were found to follow his example save a freedman and a chief centurion, whose marriage ceremony he himself attended with Agrippina.</p>

A few days before this he had betrothed him to the daughter of Sejanus, which makes me wonder all the more that some say that Drusus was treacherously slain by Sejanus.

Not to go into details about less important matters (such as revoking his grants, rescinding his decisions, substituting false letters patent, or even openly changing those which he had issued), he put to death his father-in-law Appius Silanus and the two Julias, daughters of Drusus and Germanicus, on an unsupported charge and giving them no opportunity for defence;  also Gnaeus Pompeius, the husband of his elder daughter, and Lucius Silanus who was betrothed to his younger one.  Of these Pompey was stabbed in the embraces of a favourite youth, while Silanus was compelled to abdicate his praetorship four days before the Kalends of January and to take his own life at the beginning of the year, the very day of the marriage of Claudius and Agrippina.  He inflicted the death penalty on thirty-five senators and more than three hundred Roman knights with such easy indifference, that when a centurion in reporting the death of an ex-consul said that his order had been carried out, he replied that he had given no order;  but he nevertheless approved the act, since his freedmen declared that the soldiers had done their duty in hastening to avenge their emperor without instructions.  But it is beyond all belief, that at the marriage which Messalina had contracted with her paramour Silius he signed the contract for the dowry with his own hand, being induced to do so on the ground that the marriage was a feigned one, designed to avert and turn upon another a danger which was inferred from certain portents to threaten the emperor himself.</p>

Afterwards he even subjected those who came to pay their morning calls to search, sparing none the strictest examination.  Indeed, it was not until late, and then reluctantly, that he gave up having women and young boys and girls grossly mishandled, and the cases for pens and styles taken from every man's attendant or scribe.  When Camillus began his revolution, he felt sure that Claudius could be intimidated without resorting to war;  and in fact when he ordered the emperor in an insulting, threatening, and impudent letter to give up his throne and betake himself to a life of privacy and retirement, Claudius called together the leading men and asked their advice about complying.</p>

<p>No suspicion was too trivial, nor the inspirer of it too insignificant, to drive him on to precaution and vengeance, once a slight uneasiness entered his mind.  One of two parties to a suit, when he made his morning call, took Claudius aside, and said that he had dreamed that he was murdered by someone;  then a little later pretending to recognize the assassin, he pointed out his opponent, as he was handing in his petition.  The latter was immediately seized, as if caught red-handed, and hurried off to execution.  It was in a similar way, they say, that Appius Silanus met his downfall.  When Messalina and Narcissus had put their heads together to destroy him, they agreed on their parts and the latter rushed into his patron's bed-chamber before daybreak in pretended consternation, declaring that he had dreamed that Appius had made an attack on the emperor.  Then Messalina, with assumed surprise, declared that she had had the same dream for several successive nights.  A little later, as had been arranged, Appius, who had received orders the day before to come at that time, was reported to be forcing his way in, and as if were proof positive of the truth of the dream, his immediate accusation and death were ordered.

<p>He was conscious of his tendency to wrath and resentment and excused both in an edict;  he also drew a distinction between them, promising that the former would be short and harmless and the latter not without cause.  After sharply rebuking the people of Ostia, because they had sent no boats to meet him when he entered the Tiber, and in such bitter terms that he wrote that they had reduced him to the rank of a commoner, he suddenly forgave them and all but apologised.

<p>He did not even keep quiet about his own stupidity, but in certain brief speeches he declared that he had purposely feigned it under Gaius, because otherwise he could not have escaped alive and attained his present station.  But he convinced no one, and within a short time a book was published, the title of which was "The Elevation of Fools" and its thesis, that no one feigned folly.</p>

<p>Among other things men have marvelled at his absent-mindedness and blindness, or to use the Greek terms, his μετεωρία and ἀβλεψσία.  When he had put Messalina to death, he asked shortly after taking his place at the table why the empress did not come.  He caused many of those whom he had condemned to death to be summoned the very next day to consult with him or game with him, and sent a messenger to upbraid them for sleepy-heads when they delayed to appear.  When he was planning his unlawful marriage with Agrippina, in every speech that he made he constantly called her his daughter and nursling, born and brought up in his arms.  Just before his adoption of Nero, as if it were not bad enough to adopt a stepson when he had a grown-up son of his own, he publicly declared more than once that no one had ever been taken into the Claudian family by adoption.</p>

<p>In short, he often showed such heedlessness in word and act that one would suppose that he did not know or care to know whom, with whom, when, or where he was speaking.  When a debate was going on about the butchers and vintners, he cried out in the house:  "Now, pray, who can live without a snack," and then went on to describe the abundance of the old taverns to whom he himself used to go for wine in earlier days.  He gave us one of his reasons for supporting a candidate for the quaestorship, that the man's father had once given him cold water when he was ill and needed it.  Once when a witness had been brought before the senate, he said:  "This woman was my mother's freedwoman and tire-woman, but she always regarded me as her patron;  I mention this because there are still some in my household now who do not look on me as patron."  When the people of Ostia made a public petition to him, he flew into a rage on the very tribunal and bawled out that he had no reason for obliging them;  that he was surely free if anyone was.  In fact every day, and almost every hour and minute, he would make such remarks as these;  "What! do you take me for a Telegenius?"<sup about="#mwt199" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-99" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-99" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 99;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[99]</span></a></sup> "Scold me, but hands off!" and many others of the same kind which would be unbecoming even in private citizens, not to mention a prince who lacked neither eloquence nor culture, but on the contrary constantly devoted himself to liberal pursuits.</p>

But when he gave his first reading to a large audience, he had difficulty in finishing, since he more than once threw cold water on his own performance.  For at the beginning of the reading the breaking down of several benches by a fat man raised a laugh, and even after the disturbance was quieted, Claudius could not keep from recalling the incident and renewing his guffaws.

Reports also differ as to what followed.  Many say that as soon as he swallowed the poison he became speechless, and after suffering excruciating pain all night, died just before dawn.  Some say that he first fell into a stupor, then vomited up the whole contents of his overloaded stomach, and was given a second dose, perhaps in a gruel, under pretence that he must be refreshed with food after his exhaustion, or administered in a syringe, as if he were suffering from a surfeit and required relief by that form of evacuation as well.</p>

<p>His death was kept quiet until all the arrangements were made about the succession.  Accordingly vows were offered for his safety, as if he were still ill, and the farce was kept up by bringing in comic actors, under pretence that he had asked to be entertained in that way.  He died on the third day before the Ides of October in the consulship of Asinius Marcellus and Acilius Aviola, in the sixty-fourth year of his age and the fourteenth of his reign.
