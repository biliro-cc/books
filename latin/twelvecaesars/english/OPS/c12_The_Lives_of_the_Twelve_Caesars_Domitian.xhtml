<p>Domitian was born on the ninth day before the Kalends of November of the year when his father was consul elect and was about to enter on the office in the following month, in a street of the sixth region called "the Pomegranate,"<sup about="#mwt7" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-1-n1575" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-1-n1674" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 1;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[1]</span></a></sup> in a house which he afterwards converted into a temple of the Flavian family.  He is said to have passed the period of his boyhood and his early youth in great poverty and infamy.  For he did not possess a single piece of plate and it is a well known fact that Claudius Pollio, a man of praetorian rank, against whom Nero's poem entitled "The One-eyed Man" is directed, preserved a letter in Domitian's handwriting and sometimes exhibited it, in which the future emperor promised him an assignation;  and there have not been wanting those who declared that Domitian was also debauched by Nerva, who succeeded him.  In the war with Vitellius he took refuge in the Capitol with his paternal uncle Sabinus and a part of the forces under him.  When the enemy forced an entrance and the temple was fired, he hid during the night with the guardian of the shrine, and in the morning, disguised in the garb of a follower of Isis<sup about="#mwt8" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-2-n1576" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-2-n1675" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 2;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[2]</span></a></sup> and mingling with the priests of that fickle superstition, he went across the Tiber with a single companion to the mother of one of his school-fellows.  There he was so effectually concealed, that though he was closely followed, he could not be found, in spite of a thorough search.  It was only after the victory that he ventured forth and after being hailed as Caesar,<sup about="#mwt9" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-3-n1577" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-3-n1676" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 3;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[3]</span></a></sup> he assumed the office of city praetor with consular powers, but only in name, turning over all the judicial business to his next colleague.

<p>He began an expedition against Gaul and the Germanies, which was uncalled for and from which his father's friends dissuaded him, merely that he might make himself equal to his brother in power and rank.

<p>He himself too made a remarkable pretence of modesty and especially of an interest in poetry, an art which had previously been as unfamiliar to him as it was later despised and rejected, and he even gave readings in public.  Yet in spite of all this, when Vologaesus, king of the Parthians, had asked for auxiliaries against the Alani and for one of Vespasian's sons as their leader, Domitian used every effort to have himself sent rather than Titus;  and because the affair came to nothing, he tried by gifts and promises to induce other eastern kings to make the same request.</p>

<p>On the death of his father he hesitated for some time whether to offer a double largess<sup about="#mwt20" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-9-n1584" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-9-n1682" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 9;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[9]</span></a></sup> to the soldiers, and he never had any compunction about saying that he had been left a partner in the imperial power, but that the will had been tampered with.<sup about="#mwt21" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-10-n1585" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-10-n1683" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 10;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[10]</span></a></sup>  And from that time on he never ceased to plot against his brother secretly and openly, until Titus was seized with a dangerous illness, when Domitian ordered that he be left for dead, before he had actually drawn his last breath.  And after his death he bestowed no honour upon him, save that of deification, and he often assailed his memory in ambiguous phrases, both in his speeches and in his edicts.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his reign he used to spend hours in seclusion every day, doing nothing but catch fires and stab them with a keenly-sharpened stylus.  Consequently when someone once asked whether anyone was in there with Caesar, Vibius Crispus made the witty reply:  "Not even a fly."  Then he saluted his wife Domitia as Augusta.  He had had a son by her in his second consulship, whom he lost the second year after he became emperor;  he divorced her because of her love for the actor Paris, but could not bear the separation and soon took her back, alleging that the people demanded it.</p>

<p>In his administration of the government he for some time showed himself inconsistent, with about an equal number of virtues and vices, but finally he turned the virtues also into vices;  for so far as one may guess, it was contrary to his natural disposition<sup about="#mwt23" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-11-n1587" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-11-n1684" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 11;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[11]</span></a></sup> that he was made rapacious through need and cruel through fear.</p>

Besides he gave hunts of wild beasts, gladiatorial shows at night by the light of torches, and not only combats between men but between women as well.  He was always present too at the games given by the quaestors, which he revived after they had been abandoned for some time, and invariably granted the people the privilege of calling for two pairs of gladiators from his own school, and brought them in last in all the splendour of the court.  During the whole of every gladiatorial show there always stood at his feet a small boy clad in scarlet, with an abnormally small head, with whom he used to talk a great deal, and sometimes seriously.  At any rate, he was overheard to ask him if he knew why he had decided at that last appointment day to make Mettius Rufus praefect of Egypt.  He often gave sea-fights almost with regular fleets, having dug a pool near the Tiber and surrounded it with seats;  and he continued to witness the contests amid heavy rains.</p>

<p>He also celebrated Secular games,<sup about="#mwt28" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-13-n1590" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-13-n1686" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 13;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[13]</span></a></sup> reckoning the time, not according to the year when Claudius had last given them, but by the previous calculation of Augustus.  In the course of these, to make it possible to finish a hundred races on the day of contests in the Circus, he diminished the number of laps from seven to five.<sup about="#mwt29" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-14-n1591" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-14-n1687" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 14;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[14]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>He also established a quinquennial contest in honour of Jupiter Capitolinus of a threefold character, comprising music, riding, and gymnastics, and with considerably more prizes than are awarded nowadays.

He presided at the competitions in half-boots, clad in a purple toga in the Greek fashion, and wearing upon his head a golden crown with figures of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, while by his side sat the priest of Jupiter and the college of the Flaviales,<sup about="#mwt34" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-16-n1593" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-16-n1689" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 16;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[16]</span></a></sup> similarly dressed, except that their crowns bore his image as well.

<p>He made a present to the people of three hundred sesterces each on three occasions, and in the course of one of his shows in celebration of the feast of the Seven Hills gave a plentiful banquet,<sup about="#mwt38" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-18-n1595" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-18-n1691" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 18;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[18]</span></a></sup> distributing large baskets of victuals to the senate and knights, and smaller one to the commons;  and he himself was the first to begin to eat.

<p>His campaigns he undertook partly without provocation and partly of necessity.  That against the Chatti was uncalled for, while the one against the Sarmatians was justified by the destruction of a legion with its commander.  He made two against the Dacians, the first when Oppius Sabinus an ex-consul was defeated, and the second on the overthrow of Cornelius Fuscus, prefect of the praetorian guard, to whom he had entrusted the conduct of the war.  After several battles of varying success he celebrated a double triumph over the Chatti and the Dacians.<sup about="#mwt49" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-24-n1603" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-24-n1697" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 24;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[24]</span></a></sup>  His victories over the Sarmatians he commemorated merely by the offering of a laurel crown to Jupiter of the Capitol.</p>

<p>A civil war which was set on foot by Lucius Antonius, governor of Upper Germany, was put down in the emperor's absence by a remarkable stroke of good fortune;  for at the very hour of battle the Rhine suddenly thawed and prevented his barbarian allies from crossing over to Antonius.  Domitian learned of this victory through omens before he actually had news of it, for on the very day when the decisive battle was fought a magnificent eagle enfolded his statue at Rome with its wings, uttering exultant shrieks;  and soon afterwards the report of Antony's death became so current, that several went so far as to assert positively that they had seen his head brought to Rome.</p>

He put to death Salvius Cocceianus, because he had kept the birthday of the emperor Otho, his paternal uncle;  Mettius Pompusianus, because it was commonly reported that he had an imperial nativity and carried about a map of the world on parchment and speeches of the kings and generals from Titus Livius, besides giving two of his slaves the names of Mago and Hannibal;  Sallustius Lucullus, governor of Britain, for allowing some lances of a new pattern to be named "Lucullean," after his own name;  Junius Rusticus, because he had published eulogies of Paetus Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus and called them the most upright of men;  and on the occasion of this charge he banished all the philosophers from the city and from Italy.  He also executed the younger Helvidius, alleging that in a farce composed for the stage he had under the characters of Paris and Oenone censured Domitian's divorce from his wife;  Flavius Sabinus too, one of his cousins, because on the day of the consular elections the crier had inadvertently announced him to the people as emperor elect, instead of consul.</p>

<p>After his victory in the civil war he became even more cruel, and to discover any conspirators who were in hiding, tortured many of the opposite party by a new form of inquisition, inserting fire in their privates;  and he cut off the hands of some of them.  It is certain that of the mere conspicuous only two were pardoned, a tribune of senatorial rank and a centurion, who the more clearly to prove their freedom from guilt, showed that they were of shameless unchastity and could therefore have had no influence with the general or with the soldiers.</p>

<p>His savage cruelty was not only excessive, but also cunning and sudden.  He invited one of his stewards to his bed-chamber the day before crucifying him, made him sit beside him on the couch, and dismissed him in a secure and gay frame of mind, even deigning to send him a share of his dinner.  When he was on the point of condemning the ex-consul Arrecinius Clemens, one of his intimates and tools, he treated him with as great favour as before, if not greater, and finally, as he was taking a drive with him, catching sight of his accuser he said:  "Pray, shall we hear this base slave to-morrow?"</p>

<p>To abuse men's patience the more insolently, he never pronounced an unusually dreadful sentence without a preliminary declaration of clemency, so that there came to be no more certain indication of a cruel death than the leniency of his preamble.  He had brought some men charged with treason into the senate, and when he had introduced the matter by saying that he would find out that day how dear he was to the members, he had no difficulty in causing them to be condemned to suffer the ancient method of punishment.<sup about="#mwt93" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-46-n1630" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-46-n1719" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 46;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[46]</span></a></sup>  Then appalled at the cruelty of the penalty, he interposed a veto, to lessen the odium, in these words (for it will be of interest to know his exact language):  "Allow me, Fathers of the senate, to prevail on you by your love for me to grant a favour which I know I shall obtain with difficulty, namely that you allow the condemned free choice of the manner of their death;  for thus you will spare your own eyes and all men will know that I was present at the meeting of the senate."</p>

<p>Reduced to financial straits by the cost of his buildings and shows, as well as by the additions which he had made to the pay of the soldiers, he tried to lighten the military expenses by diminishing the number of his troops;  but perceiving that in this way he exposed himself to the attacks of the barbarians, and nevertheless had difficulty in easing his burdens, he had no hesitation in resorting to every sort of robbery.  The property of the living and the dead was seized everywhere on any charge brought by any accuser.  It was enough to allege any action or word derogatory to the majesty of the prince.

<p>In this way he became an object of terror and hatred to all, but he was overthrown at last by a conspiracy of his friends and favourite freedmen, to which his wife was also privy.

Now at last she returned a most direful one, not without the mention of bloodshed.</p>

<p>He dreamed that Minerva, whom he worshipped with superstitious veneration, came forth from her shrine and declared that she could no longer protect him, since she had been disarmed by Jupiter.  Yet there was nothing by which he was so much disturbed as a prediction of the astrologer Ascletarion and what befell him.  When this man was accused before the emperor and did not deny that he had spoken of certain things which he had foreseen through his art, he was asked what his own end would be.  When he replied that he would shortly be rent by dogs, Domitian ordered him killed at once;  but to prove the fallibility of his art, he ordered besides that his funeral be attended to with the greatest care.<sup about="#mwt129" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-64-n1652" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-64-n1737" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 64;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[64]</span></a></sup>  While this was being done, it chanced that the pyre was overset by a sudden storm and that the dogs mangled the corpse, which was only partly consumed;  and that an actor of farces called Latinus, who happened to pass by and see the incident, told it to Domitian at the dinner table, with the rest of the day's gossip.</p>

<p>The day before he was killed he gave orders to have some apples which were offered him kept until the following day, and added:  "If only I am spared to eat them";  then turning to his companions, he declared that on the following day the moon would be stained with blood in Aquarius, and that a deed would be done of which men would talk all over the world.  At about midnight he was so terrified that he leaped from his bed.  The next morning he conducted a trial of a soothsayer sent from Germany, who when consulted about the lightning strokes had foretold a change of rulers, and condemned him to death.  While he was vigorously scratching a festered wart on his forehead, and had drawn blood, he said:  "May this be all."  Then he asked the time, and by pre-arrangement the sixth hour was announced to him, instead of the fifth, which he feared.  Filled with joy at this, and believing all danger now past, he was hastening to the bath, when his chamberlain Parthenius changed his purpose by announcing that someone had called about a matter of great moment and would not be put off.

Then pretending to betray a conspiracy and for that reason being given an audience, he stabbed the emperor in the groin as he was reading a paper which the assassin handed him, and stood in a state of amazement.  As the wounded prince attempted to resist, he was slain with seven wounds by Clodianus, a subaltern, Maximus, a freedman of Parthenius, Satur, decurion of the chamberlains, and a gladiator from the imperial school.

Meanwhile the emperor grappled with Stephanus and bore him to the ground, where they struggled for a long time, Domitian trying now to wrest the dagger from his assailant's hands and now to gouge out his eyes with his lacerated fingers.</p>

He was so sensitive about his baldness, that he regarded it as a personal insult if anyone else was twitted with that defect in jest or in earnest;  though in a book "On the Care of the Hair," which he published and dedicated to a friend, he wrote the following by way of consolation to the man and himself:<br/><br/>
"Do you not see that I am too tall and comely to look on?"<sup about="#mwt137" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-68-n1659" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-68-n1741" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 68;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[68]</span></a></sup>  And yet the same fate awaits my hair, and I bear with resignation the ageing of my locks in youth.

<p>He was incapable of exertion and seldom went about the city on foot, while on his campaigns and journeys he rarely rode on horseback, but was regularly carried in a litter.

Sometimes he would have a slave stand at a distance and hold out the palm of his right hand for a mark, with the fingers spread;  then he directed his arrows with such accuracy that they passed harmlessly between the fingers.</p>

Yet he never took any pains to become acquainted with history or poetry, or even to acquiring an ordinary good style.  He read nothing except the memoirs and transactions of Tiberius Caesar;  for his letters, speeches and proclamations he relied on others' talents.  Yet his conversation was not inelegant, and some of his sayings were even noteworthy.  "How I wish," said he, "that I were as fine looking as Maecius thinks he is."  He declared too that the head of a certain man whose hair had changed colour in such a way that it was partly reddish and partly grey, was like "snow on which mead had been poured."</p>

<p>He used to say that the lot of princes was most unhappy, since when they discovered a conspiracy, no one believed them unless they had been killed.</p>

<p>Whenever he had leisure he amused himself with playing at dice, even on working days and in the morning hours.  He went to the bath before the end of the forenoon and lunched to the point of satiety, so that at dinner he rarely took anything except a Matian apple<sup about="#mwt145" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-72-n1666" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-72-n1745" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 72;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[72]</span></a></sup> and a moderate amount of wine from a jug.  He gave numerous and generous banquets, but usually ended them early;  in no case did he protract them beyond sunset, or follow them by a drinking bout.  In fact, he did nothing until the hour for retiring except walk alone in a retired place.</p>

<p>He was excessively lustful.  His constant sexual intercourse he called bed-wrestling, as if it were a kind of exercise.  It was reported that he depilated his concubines with his own hand and swam with common prostitutes.  After persistently refusing his niece, who was offered him in marriage when she was still a maid, because he was entangled in an intrigue with Domitia, he seduced her shortly afterwards when she became the wife of another, and that too during the lifetime of Titus.  Later, when she was bereft of father and husband, he loved her ardently and without disguise, and even became the cause of her death by compelling her to get rid of a child of his by abortion.<sup about="#mwt147" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-73-n1668" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-73-n1746" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 73;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[73]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The people received the news of his death with indifference, but the soldiers were greatly grieved and at once attempted to call him the Deified Domitian;  while they were prepared also to avenge him, had they not lacked leaders.  This, however, they did accomplish a little later by most insistently demanding the execution of his murderers.  The senators on the contrary were so overjoyed, that they raced to fill the House, where they did not refrain from assailing the dead emperor with the most insulting and stinging kind of outcries.  They even had ladders brought and his shields<sup about="#mwt150" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-74-n1670" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-74-n1747" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 74;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[74]</span></a></sup> and images torn down before their eyes and dashed upon the ground;  finally they passed a decree that his inscriptions should everywhere be erased, and all record of him obliterated.<sup about="#mwt151" class="mw-ref reference" id="cite_ref-75-n1671" rel="dc:references" typeof="mw:Extension/ref"><a xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" href="#cite_note-75-n1748" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 75;" epub:type="noteref"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[75]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>A few months before he was killed, a raven perched on the Capitolium and cried "All will be well," an omen which some interpreted as follows:<br/><br/>

Domitian himself, it is said, dreamed that a golden hump grew out on his back, and he regarded this as an infallible sign that the condition of the empire would be happier and more prosperous after his time;  and this was shortly shown to be true through the uprightness and moderate rule of the succeeding emperors.</p>
