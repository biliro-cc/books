<body class="x-ebookmaker"><p>36. Bordering on the Chauci and Catti are the Cherusci; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-188" id="linknoteref-188" class="pginternal"><small>188</small></a> who, for want of an enemy, long cherished a too lasting and enfeebling peace: a state more flattering than secure; since the repose enjoyed amidst ambitious and powerful neighbors is treacherous; and when an appeal is made to the sword, moderation and probity are names appropriated by the victors. Thus, the Cherusci, who formerly bore the titles of just and upright, are now charged with cowardice and folly; and the good fortune of the Catti, who subdued them, has grown into wisdom. The ruin of the Cherusci involved that of the Fosi, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-189" id="linknoteref-189" class="pginternal"><small>189</small></a> a neighboring tribe, equal partakers of their adversity, although they had enjoyed an inferior share of their prosperity.</p>
<p>37. In the same quarter of Germany, adjacent to the ocean, dwell the Cimbri; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-191" id="linknoteref-191" class="pginternal"><small>191</small></a> a small <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-192" id="linknoteref-192" class="pginternal"><small>192</small></a> state at present, but great in renown. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-193" id="linknoteref-193" class="pginternal"><small>193</small></a> Of their past grandeur extensive vestiges still remain, in encampments and lines on either shore, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-194" id="linknoteref-194" class="pginternal"><small>194</small></a> from the compass of which the strength and numbers of the nation may still be computed, and credit derived to the account of so prodigious an army. It was in the 640th year of Rome that the arms of the Cimbri were first heard of, under the consulate of Caecilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo; from which era to the second consulate of the emperor Trajan <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-195" id="linknoteref-195" class="pginternal"><small>195</small></a> is a period of nearly 210 years. So long has Germany withstood the arms of Rome. During this long interval many mutual wounds have been inflicted. Not the Samnite, the Carthaginian, Spain, Gaul, or Parthia, have given more frequent alarms; for the liberty of the Germans is more vigorous than the monarchy of the Arsacidae. What has the East, which has itself lost Pacorus, and suffered an overthrow from Ventidius, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-196" id="linknoteref-196" class="pginternal"><small>196</small></a> to boast against us, but the slaughter of Crassus? But the Germans, by the defeat or capture of Carbo, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-197" id="linknoteref-197" class="pginternal"><small>197</small></a> Cassius, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-198" id="linknoteref-198" class="pginternal"><small>198</small></a> Scaurus Aurelius, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-199" id="linknoteref-199" class="pginternal"><small>199</small></a> Servilius Caepio, and Cneius Manlius, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-200" id="linknoteref-200" class="pginternal"><small>200</small></a> deprived the Roman people of five consular armies; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-201" id="linknoteref-201" class="pginternal"><small>201</small></a> and afterwards took from Augustus himself Varus with three legions. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-202" id="linknoteref-202" class="pginternal"><small>202</small></a> Nor did Caius Marius <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-203" id="linknoteref-203" class="pginternal"><small>203</small></a> in Italy, the deified Julius in Gaul, or Drusus, Nero, or Germanicus <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-204" id="linknoteref-204___" class="pginternal"><small>204</small></a> in their own country, defeat then without loss. The subsequent mighty threats of Caligula terminated in ridicule. Then succeeded tranquillity; till, seizing the occasion of our discords and civil wars, they forced the winter-quarters of the legions, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-205" id="linknoteref-205" class="pginternal"><small>205</small></a> and even aimed at the possession of Gaul; and, again expelled thence, they have in latter times been rather triumphed over <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-206" id="linknoteref-206" class="pginternal"><small>206</small></a> than vanquished.</p>
<p>38. We have now to speak of the Suevi; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-207" id="linknoteref-207" class="pginternal"><small>207</small></a> who do not compose a single state, like the Catti or Tencteri, but occupy the greatest part of Germany, and are still distributed into different names and nations, although all hearing the common appellation of Suevi. It is a characteristic of this people to turn their hair sideways, and tie it beneath the poll in a knot. By this mark the Suevi are distinguished from the rest of the Germans; and the freemen of the Suevi from the slaves. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-208" id="linknoteref-208" class="pginternal"><small>208</small></a> Among other nations, this mode, either on account of some relationship with the Suevi, or from the usual propensity to imitation, is sometimes adopted; but rarely, and only during the period of youth. The Suevi, even till they are hoary, continue to have their hair growing stiffly backwards, and often it is fastened on the very crown of the head. The chiefs dress it with still greater care: and in this respect they study ornament, though of an undebasing kind. For their design is not to make love, or inspire it; they decorate themselves in this manner as they proceed to war, in order to seem taller and more terrible; and dress for the eyes of their enemies.</p>
<p>39. The Semnones <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-209" id="linknoteref-209" class="pginternal"><small>209</small></a> assert themselves to be the most ancient and noble of the Suevi; and their pretensions are confirmed by religion. At a stated time, all the people of the same lineage assemble by their delegates in a wood, consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers and ancient terror, and there by the public slaughter of a human victim celebrate the horrid origin of their barbarous rites. Another kind of reverence is paid to the grove. No person enters it without being bound with a chain, as an acknowledgment of his inferior nature, and the power of the deity residing there. If he accidentally fall, it is not lawful for him to be lifted or to rise up; they roll themselves out along the ground. The whole of their superstition has this import: that from this spot the nation derives its origin; that here is the residence of the Deity, the Governor of all, and that everything else is subject and subordinate to him. These opinions receive additional authority from the power of the Semnones, who inhabit a hundred cantons, and, from the great body they compose, consider themselves as the head of the Suevi.</p>
<p>40. The Langobardi, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-210" id="linknoteref-210" class="pginternal"><small>210</small></a> on the other hand, are ennobled by, the smallness of their numbers; since though surrounded by many powerful nations, they derive security, not from obsequiousness, but from their martial enterprise. The neighboring Reudigni, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-211" id="linknoteref-211" class="pginternal"><small>211</small></a> and the Avions, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-212" id="linknoteref-212" class="pginternal"><small>212</small></a> Angli, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-213" id="linknoteref-213" class="pginternal"><small>213</small></a> Varini, Eudoses, Suardones, and Nuithones, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-214" id="linknoteref-214" class="pginternal"><small>214</small></a> are defended by rivers or forests. Nothing remarkable occurs in any of these; except that they unite in the worship of Hertha, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-215" id="linknoteref-215" class="pginternal"><small>215</small></a> or Mother Earth; and suppose her to interfere in the affairs of men, and to visit the different nations. In an island <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-216" id="linknoteref-216" class="pginternal"><small>216</small></a> of the ocean stands a sacred and unviolated grove, in which is a consecrated chariot, covered with a veil, which the priest alone is permitted to touch. He becomes conscious of the entrance of the goddess into this secret recess; and with profound veneration attends the vehicle, which is drawn by yoked cows. At this season, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-217" id="linknoteref-217" class="pginternal"><small>217</small></a> all is joy; and every place which the goddess deigns to visit is a scene of festivity. No wars are undertaken; arms are untouched; and every hostile weapon is shut up. Peace abroad and at home are then only known; then only loved; till at length the same priest reconducts the goddess, satiated with mortal intercourse, to her temple. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-218" id="linknoteref-218" class="pginternal"><small>218</small></a> The chariot, with its curtain, and, if we may believe it, the goddess herself, then undergo ablution in a secret lake. This office is performed by slaves, whom the same lake instantly swallows up. Hence proceeds a mysterious horror; and a holy ignorance of what that can be, which is beheld only by those who are about to perish. This part of the Suevian nation extends to the most remote recesses of Germany.</p>
<p>41. If we now follow the course of the Danube, as we before did that of the Rhine, we first meet with the Hermunduri; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-219" id="linknoteref-219" class="pginternal"><small>219</small></a> a people faithful to the Romans, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-220" id="linknoteref-220" class="pginternal"><small>220</small></a> and on that account the only Germans who are admitted to commerce, not on the bank alone, but within our territories, and in the flourishing colony <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-221" id="linknoteref-221" class="pginternal"><small>221</small></a> established in the province of Rhaetia. They pass and repass at pleasure, without being attended by a guard; and while we exhibit to other nations our arms and camps alone, to these we lay open our houses and country seats, which they behold without coveting. In the country of the Hermunduri rises the Elbe; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-222" id="linknoteref-222" class="pginternal"><small>222</small></a> a river formerly celebrated and known among us, now only heard of by name.</p>
<p>42. Contiguous to the Hermunduri are the Narisci; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-223" id="linknoteref-223" class="pginternal"><small>223</small></a> and next to them, the Marcomanni <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-224" id="linknoteref-224" class="pginternal"><small>224</small></a> and Quadi. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-225" id="linknoteref-225" class="pginternal"><small>225</small></a> Of these, the Marcomanni are the most powerful and renowned; and have even acquired the country which they inhabit, by their valor in expelling the Boii. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-226" id="linknoteref-226" class="pginternal"><small>226</small></a> Nor are the Narisci and Quadi inferior in bravery; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-227" id="linknoteref-227" class="pginternal"><small>227</small></a> and this is, as it were, the van of Germany as far as it is bordered by the Danube. Within our memory the Marcomanni and Quadi were governed by kings of their own nation, of the noble line of Maroboduus <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-228" id="linknoteref-228" class="pginternal"><small>228</small></a> and Tudrus. They now submit even to foreigners; but all the power of their kings depends upon the authority of the Romans. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-229" id="linknoteref-229" class="pginternal"><small>229</small></a> We seldom assist them with our arms, but frequently with our money; nor are they the less potent on that account.</p>
<p>43. Behind these are the Marsigni, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-230" id="linknoteref-230" class="pginternal"><small>230</small></a> Gothini, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-231" id="linknoteref-231" class="pginternal"><small>231</small></a> Osi, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-232" id="linknoteref-232" class="pginternal"><small>232</small></a> and Burrii, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-233" id="linknoteref-233" class="pginternal"><small>233</small></a> who close the rear of the Marcomanni and Quadi. Of these, the Marsigni and Burrii in language <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-234" id="linknoteref-234" class="pginternal"><small>234</small></a> and dress resemble the Suevi. The Gothini and Osi prove themselves not to be Germans; the first, by their use of the Gallic, the second, of the Pannonian tongue; and both, by their submitting to pay tribute: which is levied on them, as aliens, partly by the Sarmatians, partly by the Quadi. The Gothini, to their additional disgrace, work iron mines. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-235" id="linknoteref-235" class="pginternal"><small>235</small></a> All these people inhabit but a small proportion of champaign country; their settlements are chiefly amongst forests, and on the sides and summits of mountains; for a continued ridge of mountains <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-236" id="linknoteref-236" class="pginternal"><small>236</small></a> separates Suevia from various remoter tribes. Of these, the Lygian <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-237" id="linknoteref-237" class="pginternal"><small>237</small></a> is the most extensive, and diffuses its name through several communities. It will be sufficient to name the most powerful of them—the Arii, Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii, and Naharvali. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-238" id="linknoteref-238" class="pginternal"><small>238</small></a> In the country of the latter is a grove, consecrated to religious rites of great antiquity. A priest presides over them, dressed in woman's apparel; but the gods worshipped there are said, according to the Roman interpretation, to be Castor and Pollux. Their attributes are the same; their name, Alcis. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-239" id="linknoteref-239" class="pginternal"><small>239</small></a> No images, indeed, or vestiges of foreign superstition, appear in their worship; but they are revered under the character of young men and brothers. The Arii, fierce beyond the superiority of strength they possess over the other just enumerated people, improve their natural ferocity of aspect by artificial helps. Their shields are black; their bodies painted: <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-240" id="linknoteref-240" class="pginternal"><small>240</small></a> they choose the darkest nights for an attack; and strike terror by the funereal gloom of their sable bands—no enemy being able to sustain their singular, and, as it were, infernal appearance; since in every combat the eyes are the first part subdued. Beyond the Lygii are the Gothones, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-241" id="linknoteref-241" class="pginternal"><small>241</small></a> who live under a monarchy, somewhat more strict than that of the other German nations, yet not to a degree incompatible with liberty. Adjoining to these are the Rugii <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-242" id="linknoteref-242" class="pginternal"><small>242</small></a> and Lemovii, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-243" id="linknoteref-243" class="pginternal"><small>243</small></a> situated on the sea-coast—all these tribes are distinguished by round shields, short swords, and submission to regal authority.</p>
<p>44. Next occur the communities of the Suiones, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-244" id="linknoteref-244" class="pginternal"><small>244</small></a> seated in the very Ocean, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-245" id="linknoteref-245" class="pginternal"><small>245</small></a> who, besides their strength in men and arms, also possess a naval force. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-246" id="linknoteref-246" class="pginternal"><small>246</small></a> The form of their vessels differs from ours in having a prow at each end, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-247" id="linknoteref-247" class="pginternal"><small>247</small></a> so that they are always ready to advance. They make no use of sails, nor have regular benches of oars at the sides: they row, as is practised in some rivers, without order, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, as occasion requires. These people honor wealth; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-248" id="linknoteref-248" class="pginternal"><small>248</small></a> for which reason they are subject to monarchical government, without any limitations, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-249" id="linknoteref-249" class="pginternal"><small>249</small></a> or precarious conditions of allegiance. Nor are arms allowed to be kept promiscuously, as among the other German nations: but are committed to the charge of a keeper, and he, too, a slave. The pretext is, that the Ocean defends them from any sudden incursions; and men unemployed, with arms in their hands, readily become licentious. In fact, it is for the king's interest not to entrust a noble, a freeman, or even an emancipated slave, with the custody of arms.</p>
<p>45. Beyond the Suiones is another sea, sluggish and almost stagnant, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-250" id="linknoteref-250" class="pginternal"><small>250</small></a> by which the whole globe is imagined to be girt and enclosed, from this circumstance, that the last light of the setting sun continues so vivid till its rising, as to obscure the stars. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-251" id="linknoteref-251" class="pginternal"><small>251</small></a> Popular belief adds, that the sound of his emerging <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-4.htm.html#linknote-252" id="linknoteref-252" class="pginternal"><small>252</small></a> from the ocean is also heard; and the forms of deities, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-253" id="linknoteref-253" class="pginternal"><small>253</small></a> with the rays beaming from his head, are beheld.

Useless to them, they gather it in the rough; bring it unwrought; and wonder at the price they receive. It would appear, however, to be an exudation from certain trees; since reptiles, and even winged animals, are often seen shining through it, which, entangled in it while in a liquid state, became enclosed as it hardened. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-265" id="linknoteref-265" class="pginternal"><small>265</small></a> I should therefore imagine that, as the luxuriant woods and groves in the secret recesses of the East exude frankincense and balsam, so there are the same in the islands and continents of the West; which, acted upon by the near rays of the sun, drop their liquid juices into the subjacent sea, whence, by the force of tempests, they are thrown out upon the opposite coasts. If the nature of amber be examined by the application of fire, it kindles like a torch, with a thick and odorous flame; and presently resolves into a glutinous matter resembling pitch or resin. The several communities of the Sitones <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-266" id="linknoteref-266" class="pginternal"><small>266</small></a> succeed those of the Suiones; to whom they are similar in other respects, but differ in submitting to a female reign; so far have they degenerated, not only from liberty, but even from slavery. Here Suevia terminates.</p>
<p>46. I am in doubt whether to reckon the Peucini, Venedi, and Fenni among the Germans or Sarmatians; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-267" id="linknoteref-267" class="pginternal"><small>267</small></a> although the Peucini, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-268" id="linknoteref-268" class="pginternal"><small>268</small></a> who are by some called Bastarnae, agree with the Germans in language, apparel, and habitations. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-269" id="linknoteref-269" class="pginternal"><small>269</small></a> All of them live in filth and laziness. The intermarriages of their chiefs with the Sarmatians have debased them by a mixture of the manners of that people. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-270" id="linknoteref-270" class="pginternal"><small>270</small></a> The Venedi have drawn much from this source; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-271" id="linknoteref-271" class="pginternal"><small>271</small></a> for they overrun in their predatory excursions all the woody and mountainous tracts between the Peucini and Fenni. Yet even these are rather to be referred to the Germans, since they build houses, carry shields, and travel with speed on foot; in all which particulars they totally differ from the Sarmatians, who pass their time in wagons and on horseback. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-272" id="linknoteref-272" class="pginternal"><small>272</small></a> The Fenni <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-273" id="linknoteref-273" class="pginternal"><small>273</small></a> live in a state of amazing savageness and squalid poverty. They are destitute of arms, horses, and settled abodes: their food is herbs; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-274" id="linknoteref-274" class="pginternal"><small>274</small></a> their clothing, skins; their bed, the ground.

Nor do they provide any other shelter for their infants from wild beasts and storms, than a covering of branches twisted together. This is the resort of youth; this is the receptacle of old age. Yet even this way of life is in their estimation happier than groaning over the plough; toiling in the erection of houses; subjecting their own fortunes and those of others to the agitations of alternate hope and fear. Secure against men, secure against the gods, they have attained the most difficult point, not to need even a wish.</p>
<p>All our further accounts are intermixed with fable; as, that the Hellusii and Oxionae <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-276" id="linknoteref-276" class="pginternal"><small>276</small></a> have human faces, with the bodies and limbs of wild beasts.

<h2 id="pgepubid00005">THE LIFE OF CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA.</h2>
<p>[This work is supposed by the commentators to have been written before the treatise on the manners of the Germans, in the third consulship of the emperor Nerva, and the second of Verginius Rufus, in the year of Rome 850, and of the Christian era 97. Brotier accedes to this opinion; but the reason which he assigns does not seem to be satisfactory. He observes that Tacitus, in the third section, mentions the emperor Nerva; but as he does not call him Divus Nerva, the deified Nerva, the learned commentator infers that Nerva was still living. This reasoning might have some weight, if we did not read, in section 44, that it was the ardent wish of Agricola that he might live to behold Trajan in the imperial seat. If Nerva was then alive, the wish to see another in his room would have been an awkward compliment to the reigning prince. It is, perhaps, for this reason that Lipsius thinks this very elegant tract was written at the same time with the Manners of the Germans, in the beginning of the emperor Trajan. The question is not very material, since conjecture alone must decide it. The piece itself is admitted to be a masterpiece in the kind. Tacitus was son-in-law to Agricola; and while filial piety breathes through his work, he never departs from the integrity of his own character. He has left an historical monument highly interesting to every Briton, who wishes to know the manners of his ancestors, and the spirit of liberty that from the earliest time distinguished the natives of Britain. "Agricola," as Hume observes, "was the general who finally established the dominion of the Romans in this island. He governed, it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. He carried his victorious arms northward: defeated the Britons in every encounter, pierced into the forests and the mountains of Caledonia, reduced every state to subjection in the southern parts of the island, and chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable spirits, who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude under the victors. He defeated them in a decisive action, which they fought under Galgacus; and having fixed a chain of garrisons between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he cut off the ruder and more barren parts of the island, and secured the Roman province from the incursions of the barbarous inhabitants. During these military enterprises he neglected not the arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among the Britons; taught them to desire and raise all the conveniences of life; reconciled them to the Roman language and manners; instructed them in letters and science; and employed every expedient to render those chains, which he had forged, both easy and agreeable to them." (Hume's Hist. vol. i. p. 9.) In this passage Mr. Hume has given a summary of the Life of Agricola. It is extended by Tacitus in a style more open than the didactic form of the essay on the German Manners required, but still with the precision, both in sentiment and diction, peculiar to the author. In rich but subdued colors he gives a striking picture of Agricola, leaving to posterity a portion of history which it would be in vain to seek in the dry gazette style of Suetonius, or in the page of any writer of that period.]</p>
<p>1. The ancient custom of transmitting to posterity the actions and manners of famous men, has not been neglected even by the present age, incurious though it be about those belonging to it, whenever any exalted and noble degree of virtue has triumphed over that false estimation of merit, and that ill-will to it, by which small and great states are equally infested. In former times, however, as there was a greater propensity and freer scope for the performance of actions worthy of remembrance, so every person of distinguished abilities was induced through conscious satisfaction in the task alone, without regard to private favor or interest, to record examples of virtue. And many considered it rather as the honest confidence of integrity, than a culpable arrogance, to become their own biographers. Of this, Rutilius and Scaurus <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1001" id="linknoteref-1001" class="pginternal"><small>1</small></a> were instances; who were never yet censured on this account, nor was the fidelity of their narrative called in question; so much more candidly are virtues always estimated; in those periods which are the most favorable to their production. For myself, however, who have undertaken to be the historian of a person deceased, an apology seemed necessary; which I should not have made, had my course lain through times less cruel and hostile to virtue. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1002" id="linknoteref-1002" class="pginternal"><small>2</small></a></p>
<p>2. We read that when Arulenus Rusticus published the praises of Paetus Thrasea, and Herennius Senecio those of Priscus Helvidius, it was construed into a capital crime; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1003" id="linknoteref-1003" class="pginternal"><small>3</small></a> and the rage of tyranny was let loose not only against the authors, but against their writings; so that those monuments of exalted genius were burnt at the place of election in the forum by triumvirs appointed for the purpose. In that fire they thought to consume the voice of the Roman people, the freedom of the senate, and the conscious emotions of all mankind; crowning the deed by the expulsion of the professors of wisdom, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1004" id="linknoteref-1004" class="pginternal"><small>4</small></a> and the banishment of every liberal art, that nothing generous or honorable might remain. We gave, indeed, a consummate proof of our patience; and as remote ages saw the very utmost degree of liberty, so we, deprived by inquisitions of all the intercourse of conversation, experienced the utmost of slavery. With language we should have lost memory itself, had it been as much in our power to forget, as to be silent.</p>
<p>3. Now our spirits begin to revive. But although at the first dawning of this happy period, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1005" id="linknoteref-1005" class="pginternal"><small>5</small></a> the emperor Nerva united two things before incompatible, monarchy and liberty; and Trajan is now daily augmenting the felicity of the empire; and the public security <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1006" id="linknoteref-1006" class="pginternal"><small>6</small></a> has not only assumed hopes and wishes, but has seen those wishes arise to confidence and stability; yet, from the nature of human infirmity, remedies are more tardy in their operation than diseases; and, as bodies slowly increase, but quickly perish, so it is more easy to suppress industry and genius, than to recall them. For indolence itself acquires a charm; and sloth, however odious at first, becomes at length engaging. During the space of fifteen years, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1007" id="linknoteref-1007" class="pginternal"><small>7</small></a> a large portion of human life, how great a number have fallen by casual events, and, as was the fate of all the most distinguished, by the cruelty of the prince; whilst we, the few survivors, not of others alone, but, if I may be allowed the expression, of ourselves, find a void of so many years in our lives, which has silently brought us from youth to maturity, from mature age to the very verge of life! Still, however, I shall not regret having composed, though in rude and artless language, a memorial of past servitude, and a testimony of present blessings. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1008" id="linknoteref-1008" class="pginternal"><small>8</small></a></p>
<p>The present work, in the meantime, which is dedicated to the honor of my father-in-law, may be thought to merit approbation, or at least excuse, from the piety of the intention.</p>
<p>4. CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA was born at the ancient and illustrious colony of Forumjulii. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-1009" id="linknoteref-1009" class="pginternal"><small>9</small></a> Both his grandfathers were imperial procurators, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10010" id="linknoteref-10010" class="pginternal"><small>10</small></a> an office which confers the rank of equestrian nobility. His father, Julius Graecinus, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10011" id="linknoteref-10011" class="pginternal"><small>11</small></a> of the senatorian order, was famous for the study of eloquence and philosophy; and by these accomplishments he drew on himself the displeasure of Caius Caesar; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10012" id="linknoteref-10012" class="pginternal"><small>12</small></a> for, being commanded to undertake the accusation of Marcus Silanus, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10013" id="linknoteref-10013" class="pginternal"><small>13</small></a>—on his refusal, he was put to death. His mother was Julia Procilla, a lady of exemplary chastity. Educated with tenderness in her bosom, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10014" id="linknoteref-10014" class="pginternal"><small>14</small></a> he passed his childhood and youth in the attainment of every liberal art. He was preserved from the allurements of vice, not only by a naturally good disposition, but by being sent very early to pursue his studies at Massilia; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10015" id="linknoteref-10015" class="pginternal"><small>15</small></a> a place where Grecian politeness and provincial frugality are happily united. I remember he was used to relate, that in his early youth he should have engaged with more ardor in philosophical speculation than was suitable to a Roman and a senator, had not the prudence of his mother restrained the warmth and vehemence of his disposition: for his lofty and upright spirit, inflamed by the charms of glory and exalted reputation, led him to the pursuit with more eagerness than discretion. Reason and riper years tempered his warmth; and from the study of wisdom, he retained what is most difficult to compass,—moderation.</p>
<p>5. He learned the rudiments of war in Britain, under Suetonius Paullinus, an active and prudent commander, who chose him for his tent companion, in order to form an estimate of his merit. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10016" id="linknoteref-10016" class="pginternal"><small>16</small></a> Nor did Agricola, like many young men, who convert military service into wanton pastime, avail himself licentiously or slothfully of his tribunitial title, or his inexperience, to spend his time in pleasures and absences from duty; but he employed himself in gaining a knowledge of the country, making himself known to the army, learning from the experienced, and imitating the best; neither pressing to be employed through vainglory, nor declining it through timidity; and performing his duty with equal solicitude and spirit. At no other time in truth was Britain more agitated or in a state of greater uncertainty. Our veterans slaughtered, our colonies burnt, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10017" id="linknoteref-10017" class="pginternal"><small>17</small></a> our armies cut off, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10018" id="linknoteref-10018" class="pginternal"><small>18</small></a>—we were then contending for safety, afterwards for victory. During this period, although all things were transacted under the conduct and direction of another, and the stress of the whole, as well as the glory of recovering the province, fell to the general's share, yet they imparted to the young Agricola skill, experience, and incentives; and the passion for military glory entered his soul; a passion ungrateful to the times, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10019" id="linknoteref-10019" class="pginternal"><small>19</small></a> in which eminence was unfavorably construed, and a great reputation was no less dangerous than a bad one.</p>
<p>6. Departing thence to undertake the offices of magistracy in Rome, he married Domitia Decidiana, a lady of illustrious descent, from which connection he derived credit and support in his pursuit of greater things. They lived together in admirable harmony and mutual affection; each giving the preference to the other; a conduct equally laudable in both, except that a greater degree of praise is due to a good wife, in proportion as a bad one deserves the greater censure. The lot of quaestorship <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10020" id="linknoteref-10020" class="pginternal"><small>20</small></a> gave him Asia for his province, and the proconsul Salvius Titianus <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10021" id="linknoteref-10021" class="pginternal"><small>21</small></a> for his superior; by neither of which circumstances was he corrupted, although the province was wealthy and open to plunder, and the proconsul, from his rapacious disposition, would readily have agreed to a mutual concealment of guilt. His family was there increased by the birth of a daughter, who was both the support of his house, and his consolation; for he lost an elder-born son in infancy. The interval between his serving the offices of quaestor and tribune of the people, and even the year of the latter magistracy, he passed in repose and inactivity; well knowing the temper of the times under Nero, in which indolence was wisdom. He maintained the same tenor of conduct when praetor; for the judiciary part of the office did not fall to his share. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10022" id="linknoteref-10022" class="pginternal"><small>22</small></a> In the exhibition of public games, and the idle trappings of dignity, he consulted propriety and the measure of his fortune; by no means approaching to extravagance, yet inclining rather to a popular course. When he was afterwards appointed by Galba to manage an inquest concerning the offerings which had been presented to the temples, by his strict attention and diligence he preserved the state from any further sacrilege than what it had suffered from Nero. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10023" id="linknoteref-10023" class="pginternal"><small>23</small></a></p>
<p>7. The following year <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10024" id="linknoteref-10024" class="pginternal"><small>24</small></a> inflicted a severe wound on his peace of mind, and his domestic concerns. The fleet of Otho, roving in a disorderly manner on the coast, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10025" id="linknoteref-10025" class="pginternal"><small>25</small></a> made a hostile descent on Intemelii, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10026" id="linknoteref-10026" class="pginternal"><small>26</small></a> a part of Liguria, in which the mother of Agricola was murdered at her own estate, her lands were ravaged, and a great part of her effects, which had invited the assassins, was carried off. As Agricola upon this event was hastening to perform the duties of filial piety, he was overtaken by the news of Vespasian's aspiring to the empire, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10027" id="linknoteref-10027" class="pginternal"><small>27</small></a> and immediately went over to his party. The first acts of power, and the government of the city, were entrusted to Mucianus; Domitian being at that time very young, and taking no other privilege from his father's elevation than that of indulging his licentious tastes. Mucianus, having approved the vigor and fidelity of Agricola in the service of raising levies, gave him the command of the twentieth legion, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10028" id="linknoteref-10028" class="pginternal"><small>28</small></a> which had appeared backward in taking the oaths, as soon as he had heard the seditious practices of his commander. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10029" id="linknoteref-10029" class="pginternal"><small>29</small></a> This legion had been unmanageable and formidable even to the consular lieutenants; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10030" id="linknoteref-10030" class="pginternal"><small>30</small></a> and its late commander, of praetorian rank, had not sufficient authority to keep it in obedience; though it was uncertain whether from his own disposition, or that of his soldiers. Agricola was therefore appointed as his successor and avenger; but, with an uncommon degree of moderation, he chose rather to have it appear that he had found the legion obedient, than that he had made it so.</p>
<p>8. Vettius Bolanus was at that time governor of Britain, and ruled with a milder sway than was suitable to so turbulent a province. Under his administration, Agricola, accustomed to obey, and taught to consult utility as well as glory, tempered his ardor, and restrained his enterprising spirit. His virtues had soon a larger field for their display, from the appointment of Petilius Cerealis, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10031" id="linknoteref-10031" class="pginternal"><small>31</small></a> a man of consular dignity, to the government. At first he only shared the fatigues and dangers of his general; but was presently allowed to partake of his glory. Cerealis frequently entrusted him with part of his army as a trial of his abilities; and from the event sometimes enlarged his command. On these occasions, Agricola was never ostentatious in assuming to himself the merit of his exploits; but always, as a subordinate officer, gave the honor of his good fortune to his superior. Thus, by his spirit in executing orders, and his modesty in reporting his success, he avoided envy, yet did not fail of acquiring reputation.</p>
<p>9. On his return from commanding the legion he was raised by Vespasian to the patrician order, and then invested with the government of Aquitania, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10032" id="linknoteref-10032" class="pginternal"><small>32</small></a> a distinguished promotion, both in respect to the office itself, and the hopes of the consulate to which it destined him. It is a common supposition that military men, habituated to the unscrupulous and summary processes of camps, where things are carried with a strong hand, are deficient in the address and subtlety of genius requisite in civil jurisdiction. Agricola, however, by his natural prudence, was enabled to act with facility and precision even among civilians. He distinguished the hours of business from those of relaxation. When the court or tribunal demanded his presence, he was grave, intent, awful, yet generally inclined to lenity. When the duties of his office were over, the man of power was instantly laid aside. Nothing of sternness, arrogance, or rapaciousness appeared; and, what was a singular felicity, his affability did not impair his authority, nor his severity render him less beloved. To mention integrity and freedom from corruption in such a man, would be an affront to his virtues. He did not even court reputation, an object to which men of worth frequently sacrifice, by ostentation or artifice: equally avoiding competition with, his colleagues, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10033" id="linknoteref-10033" class="pginternal"><small>33</small></a> and contention with the procurators. To overcome in such a contest he thought inglorious; and to be put down, a disgrace. Somewhat less than three years were spent in this office, when he was recalled to the immediate prospect of the consulate; while at the same time a popular opinion prevailed that the government of Britain would be conferred upon him; an opinion not founded upon any suggestions of his own, but upon his being thought equal to the station. Common fame does not always err, sometimes it even directs a choice. When consul, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10034" id="linknoteref-10034" class="pginternal"><small>34</small></a> he contracted his daughter, a lady already of the happiest promise, to myself, then a very young man; and after his office was expired I received her in marriage. He was immediately appointed governor of Britain, and the pontificate <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10035" id="linknoteref-10035" class="pginternal"><small>35</small></a> was added to his other dignities.</p>
<p>10. The situation and inhabitants of Britain have been described by many writers; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10036" id="linknoteref-10036" class="pginternal"><small>36</small></a> and I shall not add to the number with the view of vying with them in accuracy and ingenuity, but because it was first thoroughly subdued in the period of the present history. Those things which, while yet unascertained, they embellished with their eloquence, shall here be related with a faithful adherence to known facts. Britain, the largest of all the islands which have come within the knowledge of the Romans, stretches on the east towards Germany, on the west towards Spain, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10037" id="linknoteref-10037" class="pginternal"><small>37</small></a> and on the south it is even within sight of Gaul. Its northern extremity has no opposite land, but is washed by a wide and open sea. Livy, the most eloquent of ancient, and Fabius Rusticus, of modern writers, have likened the figure of Britain to an oblong target, or a two-edged axe. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10038" id="linknoteref-10038" class="pginternal"><small>38</small></a> And this is in reality its appearance, exclusive of Caledonia; whence it has been popularly attributed to the whole island. But that tract of country, irregularly stretching out to an immense length towards the furthest shore, is gradually contracted in form of a wedge. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10039" id="linknoteref-10039" class="pginternal"><small>39</small></a> The Roman fleet, at this period first sailing round this remotest coast, gave certain proof that Britain was an island; and at the same time discovered and subdued the Orcades, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10040" id="linknoteref-10040" class="pginternal"><small>40</small></a> islands till then unknown. Thule <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10041" id="linknoteref-10041" class="pginternal"><small>41</small></a> was also distinctly seen, which winter and eternal snow had hitherto concealed. The sea is reported to be sluggish and laborious to the rower; and even to be scarcely agitated by winds. The cause of this stagnation I imagine to be the deficiency of land and mountains where tempests are generated; and the difficulty with which such a mighty mass of waters, in an uninterrupted main, is put in motion. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10042" id="linknoteref-10042" class="pginternal"><small>42</small></a> It is not the business of this work to investigate the nature of the ocean and the tides; a subject which many writers have already undertaken. I shall only add one circumstance: that the dominion of the sea is nowhere more extensive; that it carries many currents in this direction and in that; and its ebbings and flowings are not confined to the shore, but it penetrates into the heart of the country, and works its way among hills and mountains, as though it were in its own domain. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10043" id="linknoteref-10043" class="pginternal"><small>43</small></a></p>
<p>11. Who were the first inhabitants of Britain, whether indigenous <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10044" id="linknoteref-10044" class="pginternal"><small>44</small></a> or immigrants, is a question involved in the obscurity usual among barbarians. Their temperament of body is various, whence deductions are formed of their different origin. Thus, the ruddy hair and large limbs of the Caledonians <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10045" id="linknoteref-10045" class="pginternal"><small>45</small></a> point out a German derivation. The swarthy complexion and curled hair of the Silures, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10046" id="linknoteref-10046" class="pginternal"><small>46</small></a> together with their situation opposite to Spain, render it probable that a colony of the ancient Iberi <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10047" id="linknoteref-10047" class="pginternal"><small>47</small></a> possessed themselves of that territory. They who are nearest Gaul <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10048" id="linknoteref-10048" class="pginternal"><small>48</small></a> resemble the inhabitants of that country; whether from the duration of hereditary influence, or whether it be that when lands jut forward in opposite directions, climate gives the same condition of body to the inhabitants of both. <a id="linknoteref-10049" class="pgkilled"><small>49</small></a> On a general survey, however, it appears probable that the Gauls originally took possession of the neighboring coast. The sacred rites and superstitions <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10050" id="linknoteref-10050" class="pginternal"><small>50</small></a> of these people are discernible among the Britons. The languages of the two nations do not greatly differ. The same audacity in provoking danger, and irresolution in facing it when present, is observable in both. The Britons, however, display more ferocity, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10051" id="linknoteref-10051" class="pginternal"><small>51</small></a> not being yet softened by a long peace: for it appears from history that the Gauls were once renowned in war, till, losing their valor with their liberty, languor and indolence entered amongst them. The same change has also taken place among those of the Britons who have been long subdued; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10052" id="linknoteref-10052" class="pginternal"><small>52</small></a> but the rest continue such as the Gauls formerly were.</p>
<p>12. Their military strength consists in infantry; some nations also make use of chariots in war; in the management of which, the most honorable person guides the reins, while his dependents fight from the chariot. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10053" id="linknoteref-10053" class="pginternal"><small>53</small></a> The Britons were formerly governed by kings, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10054" id="linknoteref-10054" class="pginternal"><small>54</small></a> but at present they are divided in factions and parties among their chiefs; and this want of union for concerting some general plan is the most favorable circumstance to us, in our designs against so powerful a people. It is seldom that two or three communities concur in repelling the common danger; and thus, while they engage singly, they are all subdued. The sky in this country is deformed by clouds and frequent rains; but the cold is never extremely rigorous. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10055" id="linknoteref-10055" class="pginternal"><small>55</small></a> The length of the days greatly exceeds that in our part of the world. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10056" id="linknoteref-10056" class="pginternal"><small>56</small></a> The nights are bright, and, at the extremity of the island, so short, that the close and return of day is scarcely distinguished by a perceptible interval. It is even asserted that, when clouds do not intervene, the splendor of the sun is visible during the whole night, and that it does not appear to rise and set, but to move across. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10057" id="linknoteref-10057" class="pginternal"><small>57</small></a> The cause of this is, that the extreme and flat parts of the earth, casting a low shadow, do not throw up the darkness, and so night falls beneath the sky and the stars. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10058" id="linknoteref-10058" class="pginternal"><small>58</small></a> The soil, though improper for the olive, the vine, and other productions of warmer climates, is fertile, and suitable for corn. Growth is quick, but maturation slow; both from the same cause, the great humidity of the ground and the atmosphere. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10059" id="linknoteref-10059" class="pginternal"><small>59</small></a> The earth yields gold and silver <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10060" id="linknoteref-10060" class="pginternal"><small>60</small></a> and other metals, the rewards of victory. The ocean produces pearls, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10061" id="linknoteref-10061" class="pginternal"><small>61</small></a> but of a cloudy and livid hue; which some impute to unskilfulness in the gatherers; for in the Red Sea the fish are plucked from the rocks alive and vigorous, but in Britain they are collected as the sea throws them up. For my own part, I can more readily conceive that the defect is in the nature of the pearls, than in our avarice.</p>
<p>13. The Britons cheerfully submit to levies, tributes, and the other services of government, if they are not treated injuriously; but such treatment they bear with impatience, their subjection only extending to obedience, not to servitude. Accordingly Julius Caesar, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10062" id="linknoteref-10062" class="pginternal"><small>62</small></a> the first Roman who entered Britain with an army, although he terrified the inhabitants by a successful engagement, and became master of the shore, may be considered rather to have transmitted the discovery than the possession of the country to posterity. The civil wars soon succeeded; the arms of the leaders were turned against their country; and a long neglect of Britain ensued, which continued even after the establishment of peace. This Augustus attributed to policy; and Tiberius to the injunctions of his predecessor. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10063" id="linknoteref-10063" class="pginternal"><small>63</small></a> It is certain that Caius Caesar <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10064" id="linknoteref-10064" class="pginternal"><small>64</small></a> meditated an expedition into Britain; but his temper, precipitate in forming schemes, and unsteady in pursuing them, together with the ill success of his mighty attempts against Germany, rendered the design abortive. Claudius <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10065" id="linknoteref-10065" class="pginternal"><small>65</small></a> accomplished the undertaking, transporting his legions and auxiliaries, and associating Vespasian in the direction of affairs, which laid the foundation of his future fortune. In this expedition, nations were subdued, kings made captive, and Vespasian was held forth to the fates.</p>
<p>14. Aulus Plautius, the first consular governor, and his successor, Ostorius Scapula, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10066" id="linknoteref-10066" class="pginternal"><small>66</small></a> were both eminent for military abilities. Under them, the nearest part of Britain was gradually reduced into the form of a province, and a colony of veterans <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10067" id="linknoteref-10067" class="pginternal"><small>67</small></a> was settled. Certain districts were bestowed upon king Cogidunus, a prince who continued in perfect fidelity within our own memory. This was done agreeably to the ancient and long established practice of the Romans, to make even kings the instruments of servitude. Didius Gallus, the next governor, preserved the acquisitions of his predecessors, and added a very few fortified posts in the remoter parts, for the reputation of enlarging his province. Veranius succeeded, but died within the year. Suetonius Paullinus then commanded with success for two years, subduing various nations, and establishing garrisons. In the confidence with which this inspired him, he undertook an expedition against the island Mona, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10068" id="linknoteref-10068" class="pginternal"><small>68</small></a> which had furnished the revolters with supplies; and thereby exposed the settlements behind him to a surprise.</p>
<p>15. For the Britons, relieved from present dread by the absence of the governor, began to hold conferences, in which they painted the miseries of servitude, compared their several injuries, and inflamed each other with such representations as these: "That the only effects of their patience were more grievous impositions upon a people who submitted with such facility. Formerly they had one king respectively; now two were set over them, the lieutenant and the procurator, the former of whom vented his rage upon their life's blood, the latter upon their properties; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10069" id="linknoteref-10069" class="pginternal"><small>69</small></a> the union or discord <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10070" id="linknoteref-10070" class="pginternal"><small>70</small></a> of these governors was equally fatal to those whom they ruled, while the officers of the one, and the centurions of the other, joined in oppressing them by all kinds of violence and contumely; so that nothing was exempted from their avarice, nothing from their lust. In battle it was the bravest who took spoils; but those whom <i>they</i> suffered to seize their houses, force away their children, and exact levies, were, for the most part, the cowardly and effeminate; as if the only lesson of suffering of which they were ignorant was how to die for their country. Yet how inconsiderable would the number of invaders appear did the Britons but compute their own forces! From considerations like these, Germany had thrown off the yoke, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10071" id="linknoteref-10071" class="pginternal"><small>71</small></a> though a river <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10072" id="linknoteref-10072" class="pginternal"><small>72</small></a> and not the ocean was its barrier. The welfare of their country, their wives, and their parents called them to arms, while avarice and luxury alone incited their enemies; who would withdraw as even the deified Julius had done, if the present race of Britons would emulate the valor of their ancestors, and not be dismayed at the event of the first or second engagement. Superior spirit and perseverence were always the share of the wretched; and the gods themselves now seemed to compassionate the Britons, by ordaining the absence of the general, and the detention of his army in another island. The most difficult point, assembling for the purpose of deliberation, was already accomplished; and there was always more danger from the discovery of designs like these, than from their execution."</p>
<p>16. Instigated by such suggestions, they unanimously rose in arms, led by Boadicea, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10073" id="linknoteref-10073" class="pginternal"><small>73</small></a> a woman of royal descent (for they make no distinction between the sexes in succession to the throne), and attacking the soldiers dispersed through the garrisons, stormed the fortified posts, and invaded the colony <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10074" id="linknoteref-10074" class="pginternal"><small>74</small></a> itself, as the seat of slavery. They omitted no species of cruelty with which rage and victory could inspire barbarians; and had not Paullinus, on being acquainted with the commotion of the province, marched speedily to its relief, Britain would have been lost. The fortune of a single battle, however, reduced it to its former subjection; though many still remained in arms, whom the consciousness of revolt, and particular dread of the governor, had driven to despair. Paullinus, although otherwise exemplary in his administration, having treated those who surrendered with severity, and having pursued too rigorous measures, as one who was revenging his own personal injury also, Petronius Turpilianus <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10075" id="linknoteref-10075" class="pginternal"><small>75</small></a> was sent in his stead, as a person more inclined to lenity, and one who, being unacquainted with the enemy's delinquency, could more easily accept their penitence. After having restored things to their former quiet state, he delivered the command to Trebellius Maximus. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10076" id="linknoteref-10076" class="pginternal"><small>76</small></a> Trebellius, indolent, and inexperienced in military affairs, maintained the tranquillity of the province by popular manners; for even the barbarians had now learned to pardon under the seductive influence of vices; and the intervention of the civil wars afforded a legitimate excuse for his inactivity. Sedition however infected the soldiers, who, instead of their usual military services, were rioting in idleness. Trebellius, after escaping the fury of his army by flight and concealment, dishonored and abased, regained a precarious authority; and a kind of tacit compact took place, of safety to the general, and licentiousness to the army. This mutiny was not attended with bloodshed. Vettius Bolanus, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10077" id="linknoteref-10077" class="pginternal"><small>77</small></a> succeeding during the continuance of the civil wars, was unable to introduce discipline into Britain. The same inaction towards the enemy, and the same insolence in the camp, continued; except that Bolanus, unblemished in his character, and not obnoxious by any crime, in some measure substituted affection in the place of authority.</p>
<p>17. At length, when Vespasian received the possession of Britain together with the rest of the world, the great commanders and well-appointed armies which were sent over abated the confidence of the enemy; and Petilius Cerealis struck terror by an attack upon the Brigantes, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10078" id="linknoteref-10078" class="pginternal"><small>78</small></a> who are reputed to compose the most populous state in the whole province. Many battles were fought, some of them attended with much bloodshed; and the greater part of the Brigantes were either brought into subjection, or involved in the ravages of war. The conduct and reputation of Cerealis were so brilliant that they might have eclipsed the splendor of a successor; yet Julius Frontinus, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10079" id="linknoteref-10079" class="pginternal"><small>79</small></a> a truly great man, supported the arduous competition, as far as circumstances would permit. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10080" id="linknoteref-10080" class="pginternal"><small>80</small></a> He subdued the strong and warlike nation of the Silures, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10081" id="linknoteref-10081" class="pginternal"><small>81</small></a> in which expedition, besides the valor of the enemy, he had the difficulties of the country to struggle with.</p>
<p>18. Such was the state of Britain, and such had been the vicissitudes of warfare, when Agricola arrived in the middle of summer; <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10082" id="linknoteref-10082" class="pginternal"><small>82</small></a> at a time when the Roman soldiers, supposing the expeditions of the year were concluded, were thinking of enjoying themselves without care, and the natives, of seizing the opportunity thus afforded them. Not long before his arrival, the Ordovices <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10083" id="linknoteref-10083" class="pginternal"><small>83</small></a> had cut off almost an entire corps of cavalry stationed on their frontiers; and the inhabitants of the province being thrown into a state of anxious suspense by this beginning, inasmuch as war was what they wished for, either approved of the example, or waited to discover the disposition of the new governor. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10084" id="linknoteref-10084" class="pginternal"><small>84</small></a> The season was now far advanced, the troops dispersed through the country, and possessed with the idea of being suffered to remain inactive during the rest of the year; circumstances which tended to retard and discourage any military enterprise; so that it was generally thought most advisable to be contented with defending the suspected posts: yet Agricola determined to march out and meet the approaching danger. For this purpose, he drew together the detachments from the legions, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10085" id="linknoteref-10085" class="pginternal"><small>85</small></a> and a small body of auxiliaries; and when he perceived that the Ordovices would not venture to descend into the plain, he led an advanced party in person to the attack, in order to inspire the rest of his troops with equal ardor. The result of the action was almost the total extirpation of the Ordovices; when Agricola, sensible that renown must be followed up, and that the future events of the war would be determined by the first success, resolved to make an attempt upon the island Mona, from the occupation of which Paullinus had been summoned by the general rebellion of Britain, as before related. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10086" id="linknoteref-10086" class="pginternal"><small>86</small></a> The usual deficiency of an unforeseen expedition appearing in the want of transport vessels, the ability and resolution of the general were exerted to supply this defect. A select body of auxiliaries, disencumbered of their baggage, who were well acquainted with the fords, and accustomed, after the manner of their country, to direct their horses and manage their arms while swimming, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10087" id="linknoteref-10087" class="pginternal"><small>87</small></a> were ordered suddenly to plunge into the channel; by which movement, the enemy, who expected the arrival of a fleet, and a formal invasion by sea, were struck with terror and astonishment, conceiving nothing arduous or insuperable to troops who thus advanced to the attack. They were therefore induced to sue for peace, and make a surrender of the island; an event which threw lustre on the name of Agricola, who, on the very entrance upon his province, had employed in toils and dangers that time which is usually devoted to ostentatious parade, and the compliments of office. Nor was he tempted, in the pride of success, to term that an expedition or a victory; which was only bridling the vanquished; nor even to announce his success in laureate despatches. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10088" id="linknoteref-10088" class="pginternal"><small>88</small></a> But this concealment of his glory served to augment it; since men were led to entertain a high idea of the grandeur of his future views, when such important services were passed over in silence.</p>
<p>19. Well acquainted with the temper of the province, and taught by the experience of former governors how little proficiency had been made by arms, when success was followed by injuries, he next undertook to eradicate the causes of war. And beginning with himself, and those next to him, he first laid restrictions upon his own household, a task no less arduous to most governors than the administration of the province. He suffered no public business to pass through the hands of his slaves or freedmen. In admitting soldiers into regular service, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10089" id="linknoteref-10089" class="pginternal"><small>89</small></a> to attendance about his person, he was not influenced by private favor, or the recommendation or solicitation of the centurions, but considered the best men as likely to prove the most faithful. He would know everything; but was content to let some things pass unnoticed. <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10090" id="linknoteref-10090" class="pginternal"><small>90</small></a> He could pardon small faults, and use severity to great ones; yet did not always punish, but was frequently satisfied with penitence. He chose rather to confer offices and employments upon such as would not offend, than to condemn those who had offended. The augmentation <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10091" id="linknoteref-10091" class="pginternal"><small>91</small></a> of tributes and contributions he mitigated by a just and equal assessment, abolishing those private exactions which were more grievous to be borne than the taxes themselves. For the inhabitants had been compelled in mockery to sit by their own locked-up granaries, to buy corn needlessly, and to sell it again at a stated price. Long and difficult journeys had also been imposed upon them; for the several districts, instead of being allowed to supply the nearest winter quarters, were forced to carry their corn to remote and devious places; by which means, what was easy to be procured by all, was converted into an article of gain to a few.</p>
<p>20. By suppressing these abuses in the first year of his administration, he established a favorable idea of peace, which, through the negligence or oppression of his predecessors, had been no less dreaded than war. At the return of summer <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10092" id="linknoteref-10092" class="pginternal"><small>92</small></a> he assembled his army. On their march, he commended the regular and orderly, and restrained the stragglers; he marked out the encampments, <a href="5185275554932768637_7524-h-5.htm.html#linknote-10093" id="linknoteref-10093" class="pginternal"><small>93</small></a> and explored in person the estuaries and forests. At the same time he perpetually harassed the enemy by sudden incursions; and, after sufficiently alarming them, by an interval of forbearance, he held to their view the allurements of peace. By this management, many states, which till that time had asserted their independence, were now induced to lay aside their animosity, and to deliver hostages. These districts were surrounded with castles and forts, disposed with so much attention and judgment, that no part of Britain, hitherto new to the Roman arms, escaped unmolested.</p>
<p>21. The succeeding winter was employed in the most salutary measures. In order, by a taste of pleasures, to reclaim the natives from that rude and unsettled state which prompted them to war, and reconcile them to quiet and tranquillity, he incited them, by private instigations and public encouragements, to erect temples, courts of justice, and dwelling-houses. He bestowed commendations upon those who were prompt in complying with his intentions, and reprimanded such as were dilatory; thus promoting a spirit of emulation which had all the force of necessity. He was also attentive to provide a liberal education for the sons of their chieftains, preferring the natural genius of the Britons to the attainments of the Gauls; and his attempts were attended with such success, that they who lately disdained to make use of the Roman language, were now ambitious of becoming eloquent. Hence the Roman habit began to be held in honor, and the toga was frequently worn. At length they gradually deviated into a taste for those luxuries which stimulate to vice; porticos, and baths, and the elegancies of the table; and this, from their inexperience, they termed politeness, whilst, in reality, it constituted a part of their slavery.</p>
